      "The Conversation is running a series, Class in Australia, to identify, illuminate and debate its many manifestations. Here, Chris Peers argues that the union movement and academics debased the currency of their beloved industrial-era notions of class.\nWhat we Australians so neatly clump together as neoliberalism is a kind of intellectual debate marked by an over-dependence on statistical evidence and a gross incapacity to engage in critical self-analysis. Strangely enough, the label should apply equally to small-l liberals and conservatives. What is absent from social analysis as promoted by the prevailing intellectual elite is an ability to balance the redundancy of socialist thought with the obsolescence of utopian philosophy.\nTo drive a middle path between what remains of the left and the prevalence of the right, it may be necessary to consider more carefully the prevailing wisdom for traces of moral and philosophical bias. The concept of human capital is a case in point. It is a relatively new idea, generated effectively from modern economic theory, which projects two different things.\nFirst, it promotes an imaginary humanity that is simplistically composed of a species-being (the human) whose characteristics are generic. Second, it ties humanity to a form of wealth or value. It does so by extending the notion of labour and transforming it into an infinite resource",

      "Revenues at General Dynamics’ aerospace division, which includes Gulfstream Aerospace and Jet Aviation, soared to nearly $1.78 billion in the first quarter, a $155 million increase from a year ago, according to financial results the company released yesterday. Segment profit in the quarter also climbed by $39 million, or 14.4 percent, to $310 million, thanks in large part to Gulfstream, though General Dynamics chairman and CEO Phebe Novakovic said Jet Aviation “made a contribution in the quarter.”\nDuring the quarter, Gulfstream delivered 30 green jets (25 large cabin, five midsize), compared with 28 (26 large cabin, two midsize) a year ago. First-quarter deliveries of completed aircraft zoomed from 19 last year (17 large cabin, two midsize) to 29 this year (25 large cabin, four midsize), indicating that the Gulfstream G650 completion backlog is abating. On this note, Novakovic said that “retrofit rework” on G650s produced before Gulfstream received full certification last fall–the cause of the completions delay–should be completed by late June.\nMeanwhile",
      "Prepare to be INSPIRED! All week we'll be introducing our NEW and fabulous design team! They're all so talented and have created some really amazing projects with our products. They really did even more than I could have hoped! Next week we'll be sharing our guest designer's project too. :) Stay tuned!\nHi! My name is Robyn Weatherspoon and I am completely in love with the art of scrapbooking! I am a very friendly and passionate person who is often told that I'm quite humorous! I am the creative and outgoing mother of three; which is a job within itself! I'm an elementary teacher by day, and a scrapbooker by night!\nI was introduced to the scrapbooking world by a co-worker about 4 years ago. I began as a cardmaker and stamper, but quickly incorporated scrapbooking layouts also. I truly enjoy the creative process of scrapbooking and find that I must scrap daily in order to remain centered and in control of my busy life. For me it is extremely therapeutic! When creating projects, I love to keep the focus of the project on my photos and compliment them with bright colors and detailed embellishments and stitching. I usually keep it simple, yet always adding a little twist to the mix!\n",
      "This was an ad designed to bring attention to child abuse. The genius of this poster is in how it was tailored to simultaneously communicate to potential victims and abusers. On the one hand, it attempts to inform adults as to the seriousness of the issue. On the other, it includes a hidden message to children: who they could contact if they find themselves a victim of abuse.\nAid to Children and Adolescents at Risk (ANAR) and ad agency Grey Group Spain launched this campaign on the streets of Spain in 2013. The technology used was that of lenticular printing, which changes an image based on the angle from which it is being viewed. This method of printing is also used in 3D presentations, and is one we plan to use in future projects.\nWe do have a few issues with this particular campaign. First would be ad placement. We feel the campaign could have had an even more profound impact if it were included in malls, amusement parks, and other high traffic areas for children. Additionally, this is seemingly an issue that would rely heavily on preventive measures to achieve a lower incidence rate. Child abuse normally happens in private areas such as one’s home, and in order to decrease the occurrence of abuse a stern warning needs to be",

      "Last week, Alex Ross tweeted a link to an article on Gramophone magazine by Philip Clark whose headline asks “What’s wrong with the classical concert experience in the 21st century?”, and whose answer to that question is, essentially, not one God damn thing. Toward the middle of the article, Mr. Clark expands the applicability of that answer from the concert experience to the purported “image problem” of classical music in general: “there is absolutely nothing wrong with classical music”, he writes, except for maybe the way we talk about it.\nI don’t know much about classical music—aside from a couple “music appreciation” classes in college, everything I know has been gleaned from magazine articles, reviews, podcasts, Wikipedia, and The Rest is Noise—so feel encouraged to disregard this as you would any other random opinion on the internet.

      "When we’re stressed out, working too hard, and running around to meet the latest deadline, or pay a stack of bills, we’re often not the nicest people to be around… far from it. If on the other hand, we shift our focus and live our life with purpose and intention, this changes. Living with purpose makes us kinder and nicer. Why is that?\nLiving With Purpose Helps You Focus On Others\nLiving with purpose often includes other people. It’s about those around you as much as about yourself. We are social creatures and we like to work with, interact with, and help those around us. When we make those relationships a priority, we take the needs of others into account. That teaches us empathy and understanding, which in turn makes us nicer and kinder to those around us.\nLiving With Purpose Takes You Out Of The Competitive Mindset\nWhen we stop trying to keep up with the Joneses and compete for the highest paying job, biggest car, and nicest house, we stop competing with everyone around us. Life is about much more than outdoing everyone else. When we realize that and focus on relationships, experiences, and helping each other out, we are kinder because we’re no longer competing for the number one spot.\n",
      "As we discussed last time, pay-per-click (PPC) ads can be a great way to send a steady stream of visitors back to your website. However, it can also be an easy way to lose your shirt if you aren’t carefully tracking your budget and the ultimate ROI of your advertisements.\nSo today, let’s focus on how to get the most out of your PPC ads by choosing the best wording and the most persuasive calls to action. You might be surprised – even the smallest tweaks in your ad’s content can make a dramatic difference in your overall conversion rates!\nThe first challenge you’ll run into when drafting your paid ads is that the character limits on popular PPC engines are notoriously short. For example, if you decide to advertise with Google’s Adwords program (by far the largest provider of these services), you’ll be held to 25 characters for your title, 70 characters for your ad text and 35 characters for your display URL. These limitations mean that each and every work you include must be carefully chosen in order to be as effective as possible.

      "HIGHWOOD, ILL. — Mahoney Plumbing here is celebrating 50 years in business on Chicago’s the North Shore.\nFor its 50th anniversary, Mahoney Plumbing kicked off a yearlong celebration beginning March 17, 2010, and ending on Saint Patrick’s Day 2011. The celebration will feature specials, education and reminders. A believer in consumer education, the company is offerings insights on ways to check whether a home’s sump pump is working; ways to prevent pipes from freezing, and simple ways to keep a garbage disposal working.\nThe company attributes its success to the people that make up the Mahoney Plumbing team. With some technicians celebrating 20 years and more with the company, the company believes its long-term success has come from their hard work.\n“Over the years we’ve become a part of our customer’s lives,” said President Dan Mahoney, a licensed plumber since 1972. “We’ve saved the day on Thanksgiving morning when the garbage disposal clogged from too many potatoes, stopped sewage from destroying the in-laws visit and updated bathrooms for homeowners to showcase at their Fourth of July barbeques.

Tell us about the university course you are currently undertaking – subjects studied, work experience etc.?\nI’m currently doing my PhD in Drama and Theatre Studies at NUI Galway, where I’m completing a thesis on queer and feminist Shakespeare performance in Ireland. I also teach in the Drama department too. Prior to that, I completed a BA in English, History, and Theatre & Performance at NUIG, before going on to do a MA in Shakespeare and Theatre at the Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham.\n2. What subjects did you study in Magh Ene College and how do these relate to your current university course?\nI studied Maths, English, History, French, Biology, and Irish. I knew I wanted to do English and History for my primary degree as I loved studying them in school, but it was really English that was my great love. I read so many great poets and novelists while at Magh Ene: Harper Lee, Eavan Boland, Shakespeare (which I now specialise in!), and Sylvia Plath (one of my very favourite writers — I still love reading her work, and would recommend The Bell Jar and Ariel to anyone). It also allowed me to hone my",

      "Clouded Bliss is the first full-length record by Oakland-based, self-proclaimed (and accurately proclaimed, I might add) “psych-sludge” trio Love Moon. It’s 10 songs of the heaviest pop you’ve ever heard. Or maybe it’s 10 songs of the catchiest sludge you’ve ever heard. Who knows. It definitely has 10 songs on it. And it’s definitely worth your time!\nLet me begin by saying that these guys must really like Torche. Or maybe I’m just projecting. Regardless, the first two songs on this album show Love Moon doing a couple of things of which Torche would seem to be a, if not the, prominent practitioner. These songs are, respectively, the upbeat sludge anthem that is album opener “Not With Me”, and the huge, deliberate, crawling-but-never-swinging elephantine riffery of title track “Clouded Bliss”. Another notable similarity is that this album sounds great, with a style of production that is clear and even shiny without ever being thin. Like Torche, Love Moon appears to strive for an aesthetic which is psychedelic without having to sound hazy, and which can weigh a ton without ever sinking.\nIndeed throughout this entire album there is a",
      "Everyone has an occasional bad day or days. When it happens to you as a dancer, it is important to get out of that funk and start applying positive energy. Below are a few tips to stay positive and help avoid any feelings of negativity when dancing:\nDon’t Compare Yourself to Others\nIf you are having “one of those days” don’t make it worse by comparing yourself to all the other dancers in the class. Focus on you are doing and what the teacher is teaching, and just try to do your best.\nTry Changing Your Look\nIf you need to change your attitude to a more positive tone, try changing your look with a different dance outfit, or change your hairstyle just to have something different. Sometimes this simple change can get you out of a funk.\nGive Yourself a Break\nDon’t be hard on yourself if you are struggling in class. Give yourself a break, and just try your best. Also remember to have fun.\nMake Small Goals\nSometimes it helps to make small goals of what you want to accomplish in class or practice rather than putting too much pressure on yourself to do everything perfect.\nIf you are going through a bad day at school or dance, try self-affirmations by sending your brain positive reinforcements. This triggers a growth in confidence and",
      "The Hills Run Red (Movie Review)\nIt's never a good sign when a movie believes its own hype, especially when you're dealing with a straight-to-video horror picture that doesn't deliver the goods. If the DVD packaging and/or promotional material feels the need to constantly remind you that the film you're about to see is one of the most shocking, revolting, and/or mind-numbingly disturbing experiences you'll ever have, there's a very strong possibility that it's going to be a total letdown. A truly effective movie, one that will savagely scar your psyche and infect your dreams for weeks to come, doesn't need to utilize cheap promotional gimmicks or misleading descriptions to separate you from your entertainment dollar. Not to shoot myself in the foot, but review quotes and self-proclamation are often employed to mask ineptitude.\nDave Parker's immensely disappointing 2009 slasher \"The Hills Run Red\" uses a sticker on the front of the packaging to warn potential viewers about the film's coarse content. And while there is a fair amount of pointless nudity, empty sex, and graphic violence peppered throughout the film, it's not nearly extreme enough in its presentation to warrant such a caveat. In this particular case, it's a",

The fire was at a home set back a couple hundred yards off the road and was engulfed in flames when crews from Huntertown, Northeast, Woodburn, Spencerville and St. Joseph departments arrived. Multiple tankers were needed because there were no water lines nearby and over a thousand feet of hose was used to get water to the home.\nAccording to the Northeast Fire chief, the fire wiped out the second story of the home.

      "An Arizona police officer, Martin Escobar, says he doesn't want to have to enforce the new immigration law and is suing. Find out why on \"AC360,\" tonight at 10 ET on CNN.\n(CNN) -- Demonstrations in support of immigrants' rights are scheduled Saturday in at least 21 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. In all, protests are planned for 47 cities.\nThe demonstrations come amid a swirl of controversy surrounding a new immigration law in Arizona that allows police to demand proof of legal residency. Arizona lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into in the state.\nCritics say the law is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling, which is illegal. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and others who support SB1070 say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts.\nThe Arizona legislature passed a series of changes to the law late Thursday in an attempt to address the accusations that the measure will lead to profiling.\nThe law, which does not go into effect for 90 days, has already drawn at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the Mexican government and other",

      "The heir to the \"next great franchise\" throne is Suzanne Collins' \"The Hunger Games\", a trilogy of young adult novels set in a dystopian future where children are annually selected to fight to the death during the titular contest. The novels are not your typical YA fare, though there is a love triangle between preposterously-named heroine Katniss Everdeen and two troubled beaus - brooding activist Gale and misunderstood baker's son Peeta - but \"Games\" has some real darkness, science fiction, and political allegory at its heart.\nAnd so, the job of \"Games\" adaptation director Gary Ross is not an easy one. Saddled with a typically rabid fanbase and a PG-13 rating, he has his work cut out for him. Happily, Mr. Ross, as he has shown in his previous efforts (\"Pleasantville\", \"Seabiscuit\"), is no stranger to pleasing crowds while remaining mildly, if not entirely, edgy. He makes solidly good films, if not great ones. And his \"Games\" is no exception. The film is about the best possible \"Hunger Games\" adaptation you could want while satisfying a mass audience.

That applies to narcissists, too.\nFrom the National Alliance on Mental Illness:\nIf you find it difficult to come to terms with your sibling's or parent's mental illness, there are many others who share your difficulty. Most siblings and adult children of people with psychiatric disorders find that mental illness in a brother, sister, or parent is a tragic event that changes everyone's life in many basic ways. Strange, unpredictable behaviors in a loved one can be devastating, and your anxiety can be high as you struggle with each episode of illness and worry about the future. It seems impossible at first, but most siblings and adult children find that over time they do gain the knowledge and skills to cope with mental illness effectively. They do have strengths they never knew they had, and they can meet situations they never even anticipated.\nA good start in",

      "DB Dental is going digital!\nAll sixteen DB Dental practices now have cutting edge digital technology consisting of digital x-rays, a digital OPG machine and Intra Oral Cameras.\nDigital radiography is a form of X-ray imaging, where digital X-ray sensors are used instead of traditional photographic film. Advantages include time efficiency through bypassing chemical processing and the ability to digitally transfer and enhance images. Also less radiation can be used to produce an image of similar contrast to conventional radiography.\nInstead of X-ray film, digital radiography uses a digital image capture device. This gives advantages of immediate image preview and availability; elimination of costly film processing steps; a wider dynamic range, which makes it more forgiving for over- and under-exposure; as well as the ability to apply special image processing techniques that enhance overall display of the image.\nA panoramic radiograph (sometimes abbreviated as OPG), is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional view of a half-circle from ear to ear.

      "Members of the Missouri House move to make sure a small portion of the Life Science Trust Fund goes toward adult stem cell research. About $3 million in the 2007 Fiscal Year would be designated to adult stem cell research, a sliver of the tobacco settlement funds that could grow over the years. The money would come from those tobacco companies that were not part of the original settlement. But Representative Bob Johnson (R-Lee’s Summit) questions the timing, pointing out that voters in November will decide whether Missouri can enact restrictions on stem cell research tougher than federal law. Sponsor Jim Lembke (R-St. Louis) worries that supporters of the initiative have painted opponents as opposed to all such research. Lembke says that’s not true, that opponents support adult stem cell research. Lembke opposes embryonic stem cell research, includingSomatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, known as SCNT.

      "Profile and interview with NYC’S Formlessfinder by John Szot\nFormlessfinder is a radical architectural practice based in New York City whose central ambition is to break through the conventions of formal idealism to reach new experiential territory in building design. John Szot caught up with Julian Rose and Garrett Ricciardi, the founders of Formlessfinder, after a busy summer shaping up some speculative work and wrapping their entry to the prestigious Museum of Modern Art’s Young Architects Program.\nThe Formlessfinder Manifesto\nForm has always tended to operate as a mechanism of control in architecture. Whether through the ancient orders, Renaissance systems of proportion, or 19th century theories of tectonics, form has provided architecture’s symbolic value, its organization, and literally given shape to its materials and structures. This tendency is stronger than ever today, despite the illusion of freedom provided by digital technologies of design and manufacture and the new geometric possibilities they offer. No matter how sophisticated the modeling software or automated the assembly, a project’s form still exists as an underlying framework, static and rational, entirely circumscribing the processes of design and construction. Today – largely due to a near ubiquitous faith in digital technology and complex geometry – architecture lacks intelligent or innovative approaches to form.\nThe",

      "So...my husband informed that my last couple of posts have been a little on the negative side. Well, heck (pardon my French) does he really expect a person to be happy 24/7. Especially since said person was sicker than a dog? I would like to think that most of the time, I am happy go lucky, glass half full, kind of gal. Going through life, counting my blessings and all that good stuff but.....every once in a while I am going to be a crabby, cranky, glass isn't even a quarter full, blech kind of gal and it's going to wind up here. I intended this blog to be a bit of personal and family history because I am a lame journal writer and I want my posterity to know that I'm not perfect. There I said it!! The secret is out Tim so you better cut and paste it before I change my mind.\nWith that said, I am actually feeling a bit more on the human side today. Not completely well but enough that I have hope that my head won't always have this yucky stuff all clogged up in there. I slept more than 5 minutes at a time last night which helped immensely.

      "Undeclared, Not Uncommitted\nPolitics may be in the future for Marc-Daniel Paul '16; Public Service is a sure thing.\nBy Renée Graham // Photographs by Mark Wilson\nDespite an interest in politics sparked by the 2008 presidential campaign of then- Illinois Senator Barack Obama and deciding in high school that he would major in government in college, Marc-Daniel Paul ’16 insists that he isn’t necessarily interested in a conventional political career. “I’m not announcing anything yet—it’s way too early for that,” he says with a laugh. “What I want to do is serve. Whether that means running for office or staying behind the scenes, in whatever way I can help out my community or my state, that’s what I want to do.”\nThe Suffolk sophomore is already off to an impressive start. Last summer, after landing an internship with Massachusetts State Senator Mark Montigny, Paul helped draft an amendment to the state budget that will save college students thousands of dollars. Ineligible for free or state-subsidized health insurance, many were required to buy school sponsored health insurance, unless they were covered by a parent’s plan. Paul and another intern, Jacob Miller, a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, pointed",
      "\"For these beings, fall is the only normal season, the only weather, there be no choice beyond.\" - Something Wicked This Way Comes. Ray Bradbury\nThere is something special and unusual about this time of year. I've always loved the Fall; Halloween in particular. The child in me relishes in any opportunity for dressup and mischief. However, lately I've thought more deeply about these feelings and want to share.\nThe Halloween we know in the USA means costumes, candy, toilet paper and shaving cream to most. In other cultures the holiday is tempered and is a prelude to the celebration of All Saints' Day. However, the fact that other, non-Christian cultures and religions have many sacred days during this time speaks to the distinction of this transition from Summer to Winter.\nSomething else I've noted about the Fall relates to my work. I am an Orthopedic Surgeon and take ER call at some community hospitals. Beginning in late September, I see a spike in the number of older folks who break their bones. Most of the fractures are hip fractures which occur with very little trauma. It's well-known in my field that a hip fracture is \"the harbinger of death,\" meaning that about 30% of older people who have a low",

      "Kit Harington, aka Jon Snow, looks masculine in his Game of Thrones costume. The star credits strength training workouts for his incredible look.\nGoT Season 7 will premiere in mid-2017. Let’s take a peek into Kit Harington’s diet and workout routine, which helped him get his six pack abs.\nHarington believes dieting is more important than exercise, so he makes sure his diet is on point. He followed a bizarre diet for Game Of Thrones. He initially had to consume a lot of food in order to gain weight. Then he had to shed the weight by weight training and doing intense workouts. For the first five weeks, he consumed a calorie rich diet that made him gain 10 kgs. Then, to get a ripped shape, he worked out rigorously for three weeks. He adopted two extreme diet plans, which is not recommended unless under the supervision of a nutrition expert.\nTo supply his body with the energy required for the intense workouts, he consumed a balanced diet of 45% carbs, 33% protein, and 20% fat. He also consumed casein protein, magnesium glycinate, and fish oils on a daily basis.\nHarington knows the importance of cheat days",
      "U.S. foreclosures rose 55% year-over-year in July (8% sequentially) to 272,171, just shy of the 273,001 record set in May, according to RealtyTrac. The year-over-year rate is in line with June's rate, which at least suggests that foreclosures aren't getting much worse.\nOne in every 464 U.S. households received a default notice, was foreclosed, or was warned of a pending auction. James Saccacio, CEO of Realty Trac:\nBank repossessions, or REOs, continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in July, posting a 184 percent year-over-year increase — compared to a 53 percent year-over-year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year-over-year increase in auction notices. The sharp rise in REOs, combined with slow sales, has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank-owned properties for sale. RealtyTrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active REO database, a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in June by the National Association of Realtors.\n",
      "I'm not a fan of war. This is nothing controversial; if someone were to admit to being a fan of war, they'd be dismissed as a sadistic sociopath. Yet, if I say that I am not a fan of Remembrance Day, I'm in danger of making myself out to be an idiot at best. Why is this?\nWell, wars cause suffering and results in massive amounts of lost lives, limbs, and livelihoods. Hence, wars are regrettable. The soldiers themselves, on the other hand, are brave and sacrificial. Therefore, they are noble and to be respected. To disagree is to defile their memory and once we forget their sacrifices, we forget the horrors of war. If we forget the horrors of war, we will rush into another one. This is the rhetoric.\nNever mind the fact that we can apparently remember very well, and rush headlong into wars regardless. Has everyone forgotten that there can't be a war without people to fight it? The soldiers are the ones that do the killing and a good amount of the dying. What is noble and respectable about that?\nRemembrance Day does not, it is claimed, glorify war, but I feel safe to say that I was not the only one who, as",
      "The history of the Ahlborn mansion starts in the early 1890's. It was constructed for the family of Henry Ahlborn, the co-founder of Verona's American Bronze Powder Manufacturing Company.\nAccording to town historian Robert Williams, the company was the only producer of bronze powder in in the region at the time. The factory would use mechanical hammers to smash solid bronze to bits so that it could be used in paints and similar decorative purposes. It's also mentioned that the company helped supply the US government with products for Project Manhattan. It was unquestionably one of the most successful businesses in Verona's history.\nMr. Ahlborn's mansion was completed just short of two decades after the company set up shop in town. The stately Victorian graced the corner of Personette and Fairview for over a hundred years before beginning to fall into disrepair. The American Bronze Powder Manufacturing Company had long since closed, and was partially renovated into a new industrial application. The mansion was not as lucky.\nAfter changing hands a number of times over the century, the home was eventually sold to a couple who had no interest in preserving the historic structure. They claimed it was \"too far gone\", as downtrodden preservationists have been hearing for decades.",

      "Live, the members of The Barr Brothers strike a balance between tried-and-true Americana and startling creativity. Their self-titled debut, which features harp-centric lullabies and also whole-hearted forays into country and blues, certainly suggests eclectic tastes and non-traditional song writing. However, the stylings of The Barr Brothers’ album merely hint at the surprises of the live show. Improvising song renditions that involved the five-person band of opening act Jocie Adams, playing an instrument invented from a roof shingle and a peanut bowl, and employing a traditional gypsy guitar technique that requires tying polyester sewing strings to Brad Barr’s guitar, The Barr Brothers ensured that there was never a predictable moment in their set.\nThe Barr Brothers seem to deliberately test how much experimentation in music can still sound familiar and aesthetically pleasing. The beginnings and endings of songs were indeterminable because the harp, guitar, bass and several hand-held noisemakers were tuned in such melodic fashions that it was difficult to tell if an instrument was being adjusted or played as an interlude between songs. Brad’s strings-on-strings technique was eery; the best way to describe it is the sound of a violin played under water. While that",

      "In 2003, the European Union threw all its weight behind bio-diesel — a fuel manufactured mostly from plant seeds — as the sustainable replacement for fossil fuel. The members created the world’s largest bio-diesel industry, and now to their sorrow are discovering the truth in what has been a mantra of the Daily Impact: renewables aren’t sustainable if they’re industrial. The realization may destroy the $13 billion industry.\nThe idea of bio-diesel is compelling. Its raw material is grown in fields, and thus renewable; its combustion produces fewer emissions than fossil fuels — in the case of carbon, only whatever carbon they absorbed while growing, allowing the argument that the books are balanced. Since the raw materials for bio-diesel — rapeseed, sunflower seed, mustard, flax and the like — are not used for human staple foods, unlike corn-based ethanol, its manufacture does not directly contribute to human hunger by raising prices and decreasing supply. Key word in the previous sentence: “directly.”\nA number of recent studies, commissioned by the European Commission and held as state secrets by them (they leaked, of course), have revealed the Achilles’ Heel of the industry.

It offers very good image quality and superb ergonomics at a very reasonable price.\nCarl Zeiss Sonnar 135 3.5 Lens review\nThe sonnar lens is a nice telephoto lens. It is not exceptional but it does its’ job well. There are two things you are likely to realise when you use this lens.\nFirst of all the build quality, even by the high Carl Zeiss standards, is amazing. Ergonomically speaking the Sonnar sets standards. The solid all metal construction, the smooth but snappy aperture settings, the grippy focusing ring and the integrated lens hood (it actually took me a couple of weeks before I realised that there was an integrated lens hood – it is that well integrated into the lens) really add up to a nice package. Although quiet heavy for its’ compact size (length: 8cm), the Sonnar is a fraction of the length of comparable tele",
      "New cancer treatment halves hospital stay\nLast updated at 10:04 04 May 2006\nThe treatment developed by UK researchers marks a \"sea change\" in treatment, an expert said.\nSome 20,000 women a year could benefit from the new biopsy and go home faster, recover better and feel less pain.\nCurrently doctors removed all the nodes in a patient's armpit to lessen the chance of a reoccurence of breast cancer. But they don't know if the nodes are infected until they are removed. This leads to unnecessary surgery for three-quarters of women who find the cancer has not spread.\nNow a new biopsy developed by Professor Robert Mansel at Cardiff University, means that just the lead or \"sentinel\" node is removed.\nIf that is clear, said Prof Mansel, then the others will not have been affected and do not need to be removed.

After a 60-day test, he plans to make the site viewable to the public.\nA digital version of the Thoroughbred Times magazine and Buyers Guide is planned for early 2014.\nContent will include news of the industry, racing, sales, horse health, and breeding largely aggregated from news releases, with no staff writers to produce original content. Free-lancers and fans can submit articles for consideration. Free-lancers will be paid, Bradshaw said.\n\"It is no longer viable in a specialty publishing market to keep salaried journalists on staff who conduct no live interviews and who principally re-format press releases to try to make them look like custom articles,\" Bradshaw said in his news release.\nThoroughbred Times was founded by Richard F.

      "The Jesse Tree is unique for a couple of reasons. First, it's a daily devotion from November 30- December 25. Secondly, its purpose is to highlight the plan, purpose, and faithfulness of God in bringing Christ to earth that first Christmas beginning at creation and weaving its way through the Old Testament - always pointing to Jesus. And we always want to point to Jesus.\nThe main source I used is found at the Reformed Church of America's website. There, you'll find everything you need to make your tree. We still use the paper ones we colored and cut out that first year we did it, and tape them to a green tree we make out of construction paper.\nBut there are instructions/ideas on the site to make fancier ornaments and something more than a construction paper tree if you want.\nI think you'll find this activity a beautiful, conversation starting activity. But just as an aside, let me say that my children aren't always excited about staying a little longer at the table to do this. They sometimes make it clear that they have places to go, and people to see. Let me encourage you to press on through any huffing and puffing or wiggly kids you have and put these truths before your kids",
      "The SEC has charged Goldman Sachs with fraud. The charges are for selling a rigged CDO package to investors, but failing to disclose that the package was designed by a hedge fund operator as a bet against the housing market. The hedge fund, Paulson & Co., would short the bonds in the package if the housing bubble burst. Goldman didn’t tell that to investors, who ended up losing when the fund went south. Rick Unger from True/Slant explains:\nThe charges revolve around a package of mortgage securities called Abacus 2007-AC1. Here’s how it worked-\nAt the request of a hedge fund operator named John Paulson, a guy who earned $2.7 billon in 2007 betting that the housing bubble was going to pop, leaving many mortgages in distress, Goldman created the fund allowing Paulson to choose the mortgage bonds he wanted included. They were all bonds that Paulson believed were the most likely to lose value and, therefore, the ones Paulson most wanted to bet against.\nGoldman then – allegedly – went out and sold the Abacus deal to overseas banks, hedge funds and other large players, knowing that the package had been purposefully constructed to lose its value.

Jay Nixon may have opened up a new political and re-election controversy with his announcement last week that Mike Nietzel would be \"joining the Governor's staff on a full-time basis as a senior policy advisor.\"\nIn the news release announcing Nietzel's appointment, Nixon said the retired college educator will be a \"trusted\" advisor \"as we continue our work to create jobs, grow our economy and move Missouri forward.\"\nBut the biggest part of the controversy may be Nietzel's $100,000 salary - a number reported in The Associated Press story about the appointment, but that was not included in the news release.\nState Sen.

      "CHAPTER ONE: Prosecutorial Discretion: Power and Privilege – The introductory chapter explains what the book is about, beginning with stark examples of how the unchecked exercise of prosecutorial discretion can produce unjust results in the criminal justice system. It discusses why prosecutorial discretion is necessary and why reform of the current system is essential. READ THIS CHAPTER\nCHAPTER TWO: The Power to Charge – The charging power is the most important prosecutorial responsibility. Together with the plea bargaining decision, it frequently predetermines the outcome of criminal cases. This chapter explores how the legal exercise of this power results in race and class disparities in the criminal justice system with a discussion of high profile cases and examples from the author’s experience as a public defender in the District of Columbia\nCHAPTER THREE: Let’s Make a Deal: The Power of the Plea Bargain – Like the charging power, plea bargains are totally within the discretion of the prosecutor. The author explains the process and provides more examples of inequitable treatment in the process.\nCHAPTER FOUR: Prosecutors and the Victims of Crime – The relationship between prosecutors and crime victims is complicated and frequently misunderstood. The author discusses the prosecutor/victim relationship and explores how race and class sometimes play a role in the treatment of crime victims.\nCHAPTER FIVE: Prosecutors and the Death Penalty – No issue makes the case for restraining prosecutorial power more forcefully than the death penalty. This chapter explains the role that prosecutors play in the implementation of the death penalty with a discussion of ongoing racial disparities. It also highlights two prosecutors who have actively opposed the death penalty.\nCHAPTER SIX: Federal Prosecutors and the Power of the Attorney General – This chapter demonstrates that all of the problematic issues that affect the prosecutorial function – unbridled discretion, unrestrained power, and the lack of accountability – are played out much more intensely in the hands of federal prosecutors. The role of federal prosecutors in the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing is explored as well as the unrestrained power of two recent attorneys general.\nCHAPTER SEVEN: Prosecutorial Misconduct: The Abuse of Power and Discretion – The author provides power evidence that prosecutorial misconduct is a fairly widespread problem with shocking examples of cases in which prosecutors withheld exculpatory information and threatened witnesses. She argues that there is a thin line between the legal exercise of prosecutorial discretion on the one hand and prosecutorial misconduct on the other.\nCHAPTER EIGHT: Prosecutorial Ethics – This chapter demonstrates that neither the current rules of professional responsibility nor the disciplinary process for lawyers adequately address the prosecution function.\nCHAPTER",

We use a VLK Licence so we totally wiped the drive so we had one partition only and didn't backup any keys.\nAfter installation I installed the drivers from here (which took some doing) then installed Office and other apps we wanted then sysprepped it ready for capture.\nThese are the links to the sites I used to create a USB capture pen drive and a bootable pen drive for deployment.\nCapture the Image\nI used this to create the capture disk, I followed steps 1, and 3 then created a capture image from WDS and copied that to the ISO folder\nMAKE SURE YOU FORMAT AS FAT32 AND USE FAT32 PE and x86 capture image\nDeploy the image\nThis was used to create the bootable deployment drive\nDo take note of the winpeshl.ini error that is listed further down the page (omit the , and the \" )\nIf any one would like I have images of both the capture pen drive and the deployment pen drive I can post online.\nAnother really useful tool was this GUI for DISM, fantastic for adding stuff into boot.wim images\nAll working well and",

      "Murano chandeliers, glittering jewelry, Venetian mirror-clad ballroom, Instagram-ready staircasewelcome to Madrids little-known throwback to turn-of-the-century aristocracy.”>\nI looooooove Seville.\nI looooooove Barcelona.\nThose are the sentences I always hear when I tell a fellow American Im headed off to Spain again.\nSpains capital city, with its labyrinthine layout and its craven failure to be perpetually awash in sunlight, sadly is often less loved by tourists. Charm is not a word often ascribed to Madrid, nor is enchanting. Sure, it has the Prado, the Palacio Real, the Gran Via and the Almudena Cathedral. But for many, more delight is to be found in picture-postcard places like Gaudis Park Guell and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, or the Alcazar and Calle Sierpes in Seville.\nBut while Madrids charms may yield themselves more slowly, there is no doubt that those charms do exist, including one of Spains most beguilingand least knowntreasures. Just across the street from the far more famous Templo de Debod sits a building that I guarantee will charm and enchantthe Museo Cerralbo.\nThis mansion built by the 17th Marqus de Cerralbo, Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa, between 1883 and 1893 is a perfect step back into turn of the century Spain. Halls of weapons and armor, over-the-top Murano chandeliers, a shimmering mirror-clad ballroom, galleries for jewelry and art, and one of the most enviable entrances Ive ever encounteredthe house is full on period-piece porn. It also provides a glimpse into the life of one of the eras more eccentric and famed figures: the Marqus was one of Spains premier archaeologists, collectors, and statesmen who was married to a woman 30 years his senior. Think Sir John Soanes Museum in London, but with a Spanish flavor.\nGiven the look of confusion on my Madrileo friends faces when I said I was going to check it out (they insisted I must have meant the Museo del Romanticismo) the Cerralbo is also still one of the citys best-kept secrets.\nWalking through the doors into the palaces iconic entryway with its dramatic marble and iron staircase and impeccable trompe loeil marbled walls will certainly give every visitor",
      "Trabia Garden is a location in Final Fantasy VIII, located on the icy northern continent of Trabia. Students (usually orphans) attend Garden, sometimes in hopes of becoming SeeDs. Selphie lived and trained here before she was transferred to Balamb Garden. Like other Gardens, Trabia Garden is built on top of an ancient Centra structure.\nTwelve years ago Cid Kramer and his wife, Edea Kramer, founded the Garden organization and constructed Balamb Garden on the island of Balamb. Afterward Galbadia Garden on the Galbadian continent was built, and finally Trabia Garden. Trabia is the smallest of the three Gardens, and the most remote, surrounded by snowy mountains and forests.\nAlthough Trabia Garden conducts itself more informally than the other Gardens, it fosters within its cadets a sense of family and dedication to the Garden. Although Trabia Garden's motto is \"Take Care Of Oneself\", the attitude of its members would be better described as \"Take Care of Each Other\".\nSelphie left Trabia to take the SeeD exam at Balamb Garden. Although she enjoys being a SeeD, she remains loyal to Trabia Garden, and speaks fondly of her time there. After the party fails to assassinate Sorceress Edea, she retaliates against Garden by launching a set of missiles at both Balamb and Trabia Gardens (Galbadia Garden is already under the sorceress's control at this point, so is not a target). Balamb escapes destruction by transforming into its mobile form and outrunning the attack, but Trabia is caught by surprise. By the time Balamb Garden arrives at Trabia, the party finds it in ruins.\nThe Garden is devastated, but does its best to comfort the survivors and pay their respects to those who were lost. Although some survivors seem to have lost hope, many students decide to rebuild the Garden, determined to refurbish it themselves. The Trabians start a charitable fund to help in the restoration process, although they refuse \"pity donations\".\nTrabia Garden is the smallest of the three Gardens, and thus its layout is more simplistic. The details of its construction are difficult to ascertain, however, given its interior is only shown after its devastation. It retains Garden's signature circular design. It is likely the building featured a two-story design with a headmaster's office on the third floor, but only the first floor accessible after its destruction.\nThe",
      "The Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae, is a government agency that purchases loans from banks and repackages them for resale to investors. There are certain minimum requirements in place for prospective borrowers to prevent Fannie Mae from purchasing loans with a high risk of default. If you are looking to buy a condominium and would like to know whether it is eligible for financing backed by Fannie Mae, you can check its website for a list of approved properties.\nIf the condominium complex is a new construction project, the owner must presell 70 percent of the units to qualify for Fannie Mae financing. For existing projects, at least half of the complex must be owner-occupied. A single owner cannot own more than 10 percent of the individual units available for sale. No more than 20 percent of the area within the complex may be reserved for commercial use. This may be a problem for multi-use facilities that include condominiums on top of a level of retail shops or restaurants.\nThe homeowners' association must keep cash reserves of at least 10 percent of the monthly budgeted income. These cash reserves may only be used for repairs to the condominium complex or to cover insurance deductibles on property damage claims made on behalf of the complex. If the complex is located in an area with historically stable property values, the owner may request an exception to the cash reserve requirement. Fannie Mae will perform a detailed investigation of the complex's financial health and the property values in the area.\nThe owner of the complex must have adequate hazard insurance to cover the buildings and all equipment, fixtures and personal property contained inside each unit. If the complex has more than 20 units, it also must have fidelity insurance covering the homeowners' association's cash reserves. Each condominium owner is required to purchase homeowners and liability insurance for his individual unit.\nTo reduce the risk of tenant default, Fannie Mae places certain restrictions on the terms of sale of each condominium unit. The seller may not accept less than a 10 percent down payment and, no payment abatements are allowed. This includes homeowners association dues paid up front by the seller as a means of enticing new buyers. The complex is not eligible for Fannie Mae financing if more than 15 percent of its tenants are more than 30 days past due on their homeowners' association dues.\n- Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images\n- How Expensive Is it to Build a Pond?\n- Can You Get a Pell Grant If You Have Been Convicted of a Drug Felony",
      "George Lucas is the star of the DVD of his 1999 blockbuster, \"Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace\" (Fox, $30). Not only does he supply audio commentary on the sci-fi adventure, he also appears in several documentaries on the second disc.\nLow-key to the extreme, Lucas is a calm, personable host, but one who is very much in charge of his Lucasfilm empire.\nThe two-disc set, which is highly enjoyable but not as inspiring as the recent \"The Godfather DVD Collection\" and the digital edition of \"Snow White,\" boasts eight hours of material.\nThe highlight of the second disc is a comprehensive documentary on the making of \"Phantom Menace,\" from early pre-production meetings to casting, the first table read, the creation of the elaborate special effects and the actual filming in England and Tunisia. Included are interviews with Lucas; producer Rick McCallum; stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd; composer John Williams and several of the special-effects supervisors.\nOne scene finds Lucas giving his friend Steven Spielberg a tour of some of the sets and creatures for the film.\nAnother extra on the second disc is a documentary featuring interviews with Lucas and directors Francis Ford Coppola and Phil Kaufman about why some scenes end up on the cutting-room floor. Lucas then introduces seven deleted scenes from \"Phantom Menace\" that were completed for the disc and explains why they were cut. These include two extended pod race sequences and a comic bit in which Jar Jar Binks nearly drowns while trying to escape from a submarine.\nThere are also five featurettes--all anchored by Lucas--exploring such topics as visual effects, costume, production design and the fight sequences. Then there are trailers, TV spots, a gallery of never-before-seen cast and crew photos and an interactive feature that utilizes the angle button to allow viewers to jump from storyboards to animatics (digital storyboards) to final film composites.\nThe digitally mastered film is presented in wide screen and includes terrific commentary from Lucas, McCallum, editor Ben Burtt and several special-effects personnel, including Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Scott Squires.\nLucas says that \"Phantom Menace\" and the three previous \"Star War\" films are constructed like silent films; the visuals and the music carry the story, and the dialogue is of only secondary importance. He says that each film is composed like a piece of music, with different themes recurring",
      "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Matt McClintock of Athens has made an immediate impact as a freshman on the Purdue University men’s cross-country team.\nThe former Madison High School star has been the Boilermakers’ top finisher in their two early-season meets.\nMcClintock made his collegiate debut Aug. 31 and was the overall winner in the Crusader Open at Valparaiso University. He covered the 6,000 meters in 18 minutes, 54.8 seconds.\nMcClintock’s Purdue teammate and a fellow Mainer, Harlow Ladd of Oakland, wound up in 22nd place with a time of 21:00.5. He was 11th for the Boilermakers.\nOn Sept. 14, at the Indiana Intercollegiates, McClintock claimed fourth place in 24:58.09. Running for the first time at 8,000 meters, he was Purdue’s top finisher and the fastest among Big Ten Conference representatives at the meet.\nFor his efforts, McClintock was named the Big Ten Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Week.\n“I have a good coach in Dave Hartman and there’s a good group of upperclassmen that have really taken us freshmen under their wing and sort of guided us through and helped us get used to racing up here,” McClintock said.\nWhile at Madison, he was a three-time Class C cross-country state champion (2009-11) and won numerous awards. He was a Footlocker All-American third-team choice as a senior and was twice named the Gatorade Circle of Champions Maine Runner of the Year.\nHe trained hard during the summer in anticipation of moving from 5K to 8K for cross-country races.\n“I ended up just about doubling my mileage from high school coming into this year,” McClintock said, “so I’m running in the upper 70s (miles) right now instead of the lower 40s.”\nMcClintock chose Purdue after he was recruited by former coach Jake Stewart, who is now the head coach at Illinois.\n“I came out on a visit and they offered me a sizeable athletic scholarship, so I really couldn’t pass up a free Purdue education,” said McClintock, who was Madison’s valedictorian last spring.\nMcClintock said the support of the veteran team members",
      "Christopher Jon Bjerknes\nI received an insulting, emotional and vulgar letter from a Ron Paul supporter, which takes issue with my exposure of Ron Paul's lies in the following blog which I published on 1 October 2008:\nThis letter quotes some of my statements and then attempts to refute them. I will repeat the quotations of my statements and then capsulize the counter-arguments from my correspondent and demonstrate that they are based on fallacies.\nI stated that,\n\"Paul lies and states that a fiat money system intrinsically causes inflation, when in fact it can as easily cause deflation.\"\nMy correspondent argues that fiat money causes inflation because it can, while acknowledging the fact that it can also cause deflation. My correspondent attempts to justify this irrationality by arguing that there is an incentive for government to generate inflation and therefore inflation is a necessary consequence of fiat money. This argument is fallacious. It is based on the false premise that there is always an incentive to generate inflation, and the argument confuses possibility with necessity. Fiat money can be used to create stability, or deflation, or inflation. My statement was factual. A government acting on behalf of its citizens has the incentive to do that which will benefit the People. A fiat money system is the most easily regulated monetary system, and can therefore best provide for the needs of the People.\nI wrote that,\n\"Paul lies and claims that a gold standard prevents inflation by preventing government from spending beyond the limitations of the money supply.\"\nMy correspondent irrationally raises a straw man to argue against as if arguing against my factual statement. This correspondent argues that a nation must mine more gold in order to print more money. It does not occur to this person that gold can be borrowed, or a nation can simply go into debts which it does not have the means to pay. These are factual statements which are not refuted by such a straw man argument, which fallacious argument is also based on false premises. Just as a person can run up debts which he cannot pay, a nation can run up debts which exceed its supply of gold. In fact, to simply create a gold standard money supply, a nation must often borrow the gold at interest, which immediately creates debts for which the nation does not have the gold to pay and must instead run up deeper debts and sacrifice more of its national wealth to the Jewish usurers who love the gold standard system. I will not here address the issues related to corruption, such as fractional reserve banking which functions well under a gold standard to",
      "| BUENOS AIRES\nBUENOS AIRES Dec 15 As Argentina's economy\nremains mired in recession and high inflation one year into\nPresident Mauricio Macri's term, economists have begun to doubt\nthe central bank can reach its inflation targets after rate cuts\nsome have called unjustified.\nThe monetary authority, run by former chief of Buenos Aires\ncity bank and Macri-appointee Federico Sturzenegger, is trying\nhard to restore credibility and independence that was largely\nlost under the previous government.\nSturzenegger and the rest of the board raised eyebrows among\neconomists, however, when they lowered rates for four straight\nweeks starting Nov. 8. It was a move that some said looked aimed\nat boosting growth rather than fulfilling the bank's\n\"There's no doubt that in the month of November, the central\nbank was acting politically,\" said Rodolfo Rossi, an orthodox\neconomist who served as central bank chief in 1989 and 1990,\nnoting that further deterioration in the recession-stricken\neconomy could have led to layoffs or unrest in December, a time\nof frequent protests in Argentina.\nFinance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay has praised the cuts,\ntelling reporters earlier this month that lower rates would lead\nto more investment, consumption and growth.\nIn September, Sturzenegger announced specific inflation\ntargets through 2019, making the bank's mandate of lowering\ninflation, rather than boosting growth, clear as it tries to\nnormalize monetary policy.\nThe central bank's stated independence under Macri have been\nwelcomed by economists and markets, after the previous board\nlargely obeyed former populist President Christina Fernandez's\ndirective to print money to finance deficits and fork up foreign\ncurrency reserves to prop up the peso currency.\nBut the November cuts tested confidence in the new\ninflation-targeting regime. Weekly cuts continued despite data\non Nov. 10 showing October inflation of 2.4 percent, well above\nthe central bank's goal for average monthly inflation of 1.5\npercent for the final quarter of the year.\nData on Thursday showed November inflation cooled to 1.6\npercent, still above-target.\nOctober inflation was particularly high because of the\nremoval of subsidies for home-heating natural gas, a one-time\nfactor.

      "Mavericks is located off of Pillar Point, about 4 miles north of downtown Half Moon Bay in the town of Princeton-by-the-Sea. You won't find signs leading to the \"hidden\" spot, but friendly locals will direct you to the right place.\nMavericks, the wave, breaks 1/2 mile offshore on a reef that remains tranquil most of the year but becomes alive in the winter when big winter storms come from the north and push enough water over the reef for a wave to form. If you visit in the spring, summer or early fall, you will find a peaceful beach with waves rolling in through the rocks and lapping at the shores. But come winter and the right swells, Mavericks comes alive, the beach is often underwater, and the rocks appear tiny in the face of the massive waves and whitewater that pounds the reef.\nIt's probably one of the most frequestly asked questions any resident of Half Moon Bay and surrounding communities hear day after day. Knowing that Mavericks is a destination for travelers worldwide is often a sense of pride, although the traffic in this small town can be downright maddening. Come winter and when the swells are big, the area around Pillar Point Harbor can become as crowded as the lineups at Mavericks.\nThe trek out to the closest beach (Pillar Point Beach) to the big wave spot is not an easy one. You cannot see the waves from the highway, and one would never know that some of the biggest waves in the world are just west of Highway 1 just by sight. No, to discover Mavericks, you have to visit Princeton-by-the-Sea and the active fishing harbor at Pillar Point Harbor. There, you will find Mavericks Surf Shop and a slip for directions to the break. That's the easiest way to go.\nFor those who wish to make the trek, look for the \"Point\" -- the bluffs just a bit northwest of the Harbor, with the looming radar station often referred to as the \"giant golf ball on the hill.\" At the base of those bluffs lies the beach where surfers enter the water for the 1/2 mile paddle to the outer reef.\nTo get there, find your way to West Point In Princeton and follow the road to the small dirt parking lot at Pillar Point beach. You cannot drive to the top of the bluff, which is part of Vandenberg AFB and off limits.\nIf you can find parking, then follow the dirt trail that follows the bluffs",
      "Aaron posted on here to say that both Bertrams and Gardners had stopped stocking Lightning Source titles, and that they were only available through what he referred to as 'back order'. This he said, had allowed Amazon.co.uk along with their other sites outside the US, to start listing LSI titles as 'out of stock' or to stop taking orders for them at all.\nI was puzzled by these comments, since neither Bertrams or Gardners routinely stock any POD titles, no matter who they are printed by (my own book, which is stocked by Gardners, is very much the exception). Most POD books are available via special order only, which is what Aaron refers to as 'back order'. What this means is that rather than Gardners etc keeping the books in stock, they are printed to order as and when needed. This is the norm for most POD titles, and the reason why they are not normally returnable, hence the fact that the majority of retailers do not keep in stock.\nHaving said this, no retailer in their right mind would refuse to obtain a book that a customer had specifically requested, for to do so would be commercial suicide. If the customer requests this book, and pays for it upfront, which they would be expected to do so, then the sale is guaranteed, so what has the retailer got to lose? It is money for old rope.\nIt is true that Amazon.co.uk was showing such titles as out of stock, but when you looked at the details for these books, Amazon also said that they would let customers know when the books were available (expected within 6 to 9 days) and not take their money until then. There is nothing sinister in this at all, so I don't understand what Aaron was so upset about.\nI emailed Richard to see what he knew and received the following reply:\n\"It would appear that Amazon managed to inadvertently route all Lighting Source books to the US printing works thus putting every POD book in Britain 'Temporarily Out of Stock' - and Gardners have not changed their policy, procedure or systems - if you start looking on Amazon now, you will see that they are all beginning to come back to normal. So a bit of a speculative storm in a tea cup - my info is from the President of Lightning Source who is a long standing business friend of mine, so I usually eventually get to the bottom of things.\"\nHe is as usual right. The majority of books are now showing as available within 24 hours - so back to business as usual.\n",

High in the Himilayas. A creature that humanity will come to know as Ladon, the last of his species. It hid secretly amongst the mountains and slumbered underneath Mt. Everest. (Humanity has thought that the vast cracks in the mountain was caused by tectonic shifts, but were actually deep entrances in which only baby dragons can enter) As centuries passed on, it was considered a myth by humanity. It continued to slumber while humanity advanced in technologically.\nThe spirit of Earth was slowly dying to to pollution and wars that continue to ravage the planet.

Then it began to beam of fire that has engulfed the Jin Mao Tower in searing flames. Then humanity got the message, they panicked and tried to flee the city. The military mobilized and began to shoot at Ladon. Missiles, rockets, bullets, bounced off the creature's impenetrable scales. When lasers were brought to bear, the scales reflected it and further destruction was continued, in about two hours, the city was in ruin, the Lujiazui skyscrapers were toppled, millions of lives were loss and the People's Liberation Army 4th company loss nearly have of its former strength.

      "(Sorry for the delay folks but we’ve been having recent issues with our blogs. Always check our regular Web site first for breaking news.)\nRookie safety Eric Reid has won the starting spot at free safety for the 49ers’ Sept. 8 season opener, and he did so by following a gradual path plotted out since his first-round selection.\nReid, drafted 18th overall, made “steady progress” over the past four months to have that starting role bestowed upon him Tuesday by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.\n“I feel like a professional football player now,” Reid said. “The first day I got here, it was a lot faster than college and the defense was tougher, but it just takes practice and repetition.”\nReid, along with most starters, likely won’t play in Thursday’s exhibition finale at San Diego. Fangio noted how Reid already “has had a lot of reps and gotten a lot of work in.”\nReid will be the 49ers’ first rookie to start on defense since Taylor Mays in 2010. The 49ers can only hope Reid follows the more decorated route taken by linebacker Patrick Willis, who’s been a Pro Bowler since he started in his 2007 rookie season.\n“He’s had his potholes with mistakes here and there but he’s been steady,” Fangio said of Reid, an LSU product.\n“He’s had his potholes with some mistakes here and there. Overall he’s just been steady,” Fangio said of Reid.\nReid beat out Craig Dahl, C.J. Spillman and Trenton Robinson for a job vacated by Dashon Goldson’s exit to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n“He’s tackled well in the games which is important for us,” Fangio added. “We lost a really good tackler last year in Goldson. He’s done a good job in tackling and we think he’ll continue to improve as the season goes on.”\nAdded coach Jim Harbaugh: “He’s shown he’s picked up the system fast and played well in games. It’s been a nice progression by him.”\nReid said he expects to soon start studying film of the 49ers’ Week 1 opponent, the Green Bay Packers. Fellow starting safety Donte Whitner praised Reid as a quick study who has “really good ball skills,” adding that Reid’s 6-foot-1, 213-pound frame can pack a wallop, too.\n— Nnamdi Asomug",

Eight subjects were tested while cycling at maximum exertion for 25 min on a stationary dynamometer. Cadence and load were varied to span a range of power outputs and myoelectric activity was measured from 10 muscles in the leg. Cycle-by-cycle variations in muscle coordination, cadence and power output were observed and the EMG intensity across all muscles was used as an estimate of the metabolic cost for each cycle. Data for the cycles at greatest power output were separated into three groups: maximum power, 80% power but lower EMG intensity and 80% power and higher EMG intensity. Torque–angular velocity relations were determined for the ankle and knee joints. During cycling at maximum power output the ankle joint was not extending at the velocity necessary for maximum power output; thus, maximum limb power occurs when some of the individual muscles cannot be generating maximum power output. Increases in EMG intensity occurred with no increase in power output from the limb: these corresponded to decreases in the efficiency and changes in coordination. Increases in power were achieved that were not matched by equivalent increases in EMG intensity, but did occur with changes in coordination. It is proposed that the power output from the limb is limited by the coordination pattern of the muscles rather than the maximum power output from any one muscle itself.\nLocomotion is an energetically expensive behaviour. Mechanical work is required for accelerating the body centre of mass and individual limb segments, for changing direction and for moving against a resistive force such as in cycling, swimming and animal flight. There is a metabolic cost to producing mechanical work from the muscles, and the ratio of the mechanical work to the total metabolic cost is the muscle efficiency (Woledge et al., 1985). Both the mechanical power production and the muscle efficiency depend on the rate at which the muscle shortens. The maximum power output from the muscles occurs while they are maximally active and shorten at their ‘optimal speed’; that is, approximately 25–36% of their maximum intrinsic speed (Josephson, 1999; Kushermick and Davies, 1969; Swoap et al., 1997; He et al., 2000), whilst the maximum muscle efficiency has been reported at a similar range of 15–29% of their maximum intrinsic speed (H",
      "Officers and directors of the nation's smallest and youngest biotech companies can look up their stock quotes once again.\nStocks in the sector were in such rapid freefall a few months ago that a glance at the stock price chart became too painful to bear.\nHow painful was the sell-off?\nI counted 30 biotech stocks that shed at least 40% of their value in the past three months, with half of them plunging by more than 50%.\nOf course, such sell-offs don't necessarily invite buying opportunities. Instead, it is wiser to focus on the soundest business models, even if they are only off 25% or 35% in this recent pullback.\nI've been spending time the past few days with the most promising biotechs. I favor those with good science, strong testing data, potentially large market opportunities and healthy cash balances. Here's a short list of biotech companies that have potentially 100% upside from here.\n|1. Verastem (Nasdaq: VSTM)\nCash: $114 million\nAnnualized cash burn: $52 million\nAlthough science has made great strides in the battle against cancer, there are still too many instances of recurring tumors, as the core cells that underlie tumors aren't fully eradicated. These cancer stem cells are hard to spot, though Verastem may be on the path to a solution. Its lead drug, VS-6063, is nearing the end of Phase II clinical trials to treat mesothelioma, while a half-dozen trials involving that and two other drugs are in earlier testing stages.\nAs with any good biotech, this one has catalysts in place for share price movement. Cantor Fitzgerald's Maar Goldstein thinks \"2014 will be a year of meaningful data flow that could drive share price appreciation. This year should bring larger milestone flow versus the prior year, including interim data readouts from (four different clinical trials).\" Her $22 target price represents 120% upside from current levels.\nInsiders have also been supportive of the stock. Since May 13, six of them acquired a collective 7,000 shares. That follows an aggressive slate of insider buying throughout 2013.\n|2.

      "The Supreme Court took up the issue of overcrowded prisons in California today, as a lawyer for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger argued that a federal court order mandating the state to reduce its prison population by 40,000 over two years was too drastic and would endanger public safety.\nCarter G. Phillips, representing California's government, called the order \"extraordinary and unprecedented\" and said that it would force the state to release thousands of prisoners. He said that the state was making progress in improving prison conditions on its own and that the federal court should not have interfered with the state's progress.\nThe controversy arose in 2009 when a panel of three federal judges ruled that crowding in California's prisons violated prisoners' constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. The panel based its decision on the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), passed by Congress in 1996, which allows federal courts, in certain circumstances, to order caps on prison population to remedy constitutional violations. With the state appealing, the order has not gone into effect.\nSeveral of the Court's more liberal members pounced on Phillips' argument that the state could handle the problem, pointing out that prisoners have argued for years in some cases that they were not receiving adequate health care.\n\"One case has been pending 20 years,\" argued Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"How much longer do we have to wait?\"\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor cited the high suicide rates in prison. \"When are you going to avoid needless deaths?\" she asked.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who is from California, said, \"At some point the court has to say you have been given enough time.\"\nPhillips acknowledged that in the past, prison conditions had led to constitutional violations, but he said California needs more time to implement a comprehensive plan, including construction of new facilities and out-of-state transfers of prisoners to ease the overcrowding.\nSupreme Court Debates California Prison Overcrowding\nLawyers for the prisoners argued that the federal court order did not mandate the release of prisoners and said that the reduction could be achieved through transfers or credits given to prisoners exhibiting good behavior.\nBut Justice Samuel Alito was skeptical.\n\"If I were a citizen of California,\" he said, \" I would be concerned about the release of 40,000 prisoners.\"\nAlito asked Donald Specter of the Prison Law Center, the public interest law firm representing prisoners, about recidivism rates. Specter acknowledged that the rates of recid",

      "Thailand's already turbulent political landscape was thrown into further turmoil Tuesday when the Constitutional Court dissolved the ruling People Power Party (PPP) and two of its coalition partners for electoral fraud. As the verdict was read that the government leadership, including the current prime minister, would step down, anti-government protesters occupying Bangkok's two main airports erupted into cheers and waived Thai flags. Red-shirted government supporters, who had gathered outside the court building to try and prevent the proceedings, dismissed the decision as a judicial coup d'etat.\nThe decisions spell the end of Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's brief term in power, as he is one of the 35-member executive board of the ruling People Power Party. Executive board members are banned from politics for five years as a result of the decision. Somchai said that he accepted the court's call for him to step down shortly after the verdict was announced; the ruling coalition, however, should remain largely intact. Regular members of the three parties the People Power Party, Chart Thai Party and Matchima Thipithai Party have 60 days to join another political party. PPP members were already preparing to migrate to the newly formed Puea Thai Party, and other parties have been set up to accommodate members of Chart Thai and Matchima Thipathai. In total, 109 lawmakers were banned.\nThe government supporters' claim that the verdict was an act of judicial activism was dismissed by some. \"The court had plenty of evidence to justify its decision,\" said Jade Donavanik, a former dean of the faculty of law at Siam University. \"This is not a judicial coup because the evidence was there. It may be perceived that way because only government coalition parties were on trial. The opposition Democrats were not, but they hadn't had any case brought against them from the beginning.\"\nThe anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy has said it will abandon its occupation of Suvarnabhumi international airport and Don Muang domestic airport, and passenger flights are expected to resume. Protesters seized the airports last Tuesday, stranding an estimated 350,000 travelers and tourists and causing untold economic losses. The capital's patience for the occupation is wearing thin. \"The PAD leaders must also be tried for breaking the law. They have trespassed on property and caused damage which they must pay for,\" Donavanik said.\nThe PAD has also been demanding that parliament be dissolved. They accuse the ruling coalition of trying to change the country's constitution to wipe away",
      "Arvixe is trying to help introduce a new paradigm to academe – the Personal Learning Environment. The PLE is a topic that has already gained quite a following and interest internationally, but is just beginning to take hold in the United States. Ames Brown of Post University is working to create a PLE consortium and formally define the PLE for all to access at w3ple.org.\nThe basic idea is that students are given a web platform to create and share their own knowledge. Post University, a traditional New England university with an excellent online program, is a notable example of how the PLE can be implemented today – all incoming students in the university’s Master of Education program create a personal website and unique domain name that they continually build upon throughout their degree curriculum.\nArvixe is uniquely prepared to serve the needs of universities, right now. Just as the M.Ed. program at Post University has a special Arvixe landing page with a simple sign-up process and custom billing, Arvixe is also expanding to make registration portals available for other universities nationwide, such as:\nLet’s start by learning about the history of the PLE and it’s role on the web, and how hosting companies such as Arvixe can help the process!\nWeb 1.0, beginning in 1994, was all about publishing and indexing static content. It was the visitors’ web as opposed to the authors’ web since it required a great deal of technical expertise to author and contribute content.\nWeb 2.0, beginning in 2004, made it a lot easier to publish content using authoring tools built right into the web as well as enabling visitors to interactively contribute to existing web content through social networking technologies.\nWeb 3.0, arriving in the next few years, will provide a much more integrated approach to authoring content across media modalities and allow this content to more easily index itself and interact with our physical surroundings. A new focus on contributing more sophisticated information to the web will merge the authoring and visiting roles of both people and devices into the next, more seamless phase of the web.\nIn the Web 3.0 world full of a dizzying array of network-attached devices such as kitchen appliances, lighting systems, traffic sensors, etc., a device will be as likely to have a dedicated ‘personal web address’ as a person.

Since the current class system was adopted in 1948, the top Phillies minor league affiliates have strung together such streaks only eight times.\nThe last time was between 1999 and 2003, when the Scranton Wilkes-Barre Red Barons ran off five straight winning seasons — the longest such streak in Phillies history — and reached the playoffs four straight times, the only time since 1961 a Phillies Triple-A affiliate made consecutive playoff appearances.\nBefore that, you have to go back to 1979-80-81 in Oklahoma City (of the defunct American Association) to find consecutive Phillies Triple-A winners. Others occurred in 1976-77 (also Oklahoma City), 1967-68-69 (San Diego and Eugene in the Pacific Coast League), 1963-64 (Arkansas in the International League), 1959-60 (Miami, IL), 1953-54 (Baltimore and Syracuse, IL), and 1948-49 (Toronto, IL).\nSo. why is that such a rare achievement for the Phillies?\nA look at the rosters might give a clue.\nThose 1999-2003 Red Barons rosters featured the likes of Jimmy Rollins, Bobby Estalella, Randy Wolf, Marlon Anderson, Pat Burrell, David Doster, Evan Thomas, Reggie Taylor, David Coggin, Eric Valent, Marlon Byrd, Johnny Estrada, Chase Utley, Vincente Padilla, Brett Myers, Brandon Duck",
      "As I looked at this week's prompt I had thoughts of my family. My Grandfather and his love of having a flutter and being quite a grump if his horse didn't win!\nI pondered this morning why it was that it was fashionable almost to have a flutter and then as I watched the news and saw the press coverage of Ascot yesterday including the delight from the Queen as her horse won a race. The race that she usually presents the cup to the winner no less. At the turn of the 20th Century the Royal household owned horses and raced them, in much the same way as they do now. That fact would have been reported in the newspapers, these were days before television. So it would have been fashionable to have raced horses, after all they were not subjected to the real need of farm work and we would been working towards a time when they were used less for transport purposes.\nThis photograph came to me from my Grandfather's first Cousin James Butcher. The description he gave me was it was\n\"One of the Crook Grandmothers\"\nAs Jim's mother was Sarah Crook before she married Walter Butcher I can surmise that this is one of Sarah's Grandmother's but which one? I have not done too much on this particular line as yet. The Crook's originated from London and came south to Worplesdon just outside of Guildford. There they marry into or are connected to the Butcher, Langford and Gunner families that were in the Worplesdon, Normandy and Wanborough area including Passengers Farm. The horse looks a bit on the slim side!\nThe pathway on the left leads to the church and where the grass verge is on the left is a row of cottages, one which is where my Grandfather lived with his parents and another that is where Walter Butcher lived with his family. There were other families there too. The house on the corner was lived in by the Spicer family.\nThis next photograph is of my Grandfather's brother Percy. He lived with his family at Manor Farm Wanborough up until about 1930 then the family moved across to Onslow Village. This was taken in 1953 by my Aunt, Percy's sister for the Coronation Procession.\nMy Mum recalls that my Grandfather's other brother, Arthur had two horses like this one called Dolly and Jack. When I asked if this was either of them Mum said no. Although how she could tell I do not know!\n",

In an interview with one of us from Beijing, President Obama said he was possibly still weeks away from making an announcement on Afghanistan. \"I will announce my decision over the next several weeks… I'm confident that at the end of this process we will be able to present to the American people in very clear terms what exactly is at stake what we intend to do, how we're going to succeed, how much it's going to cost, how long it's going to take. And I think that's what owed the American people, because frankly over the last several years that's not what they've gotten.\" He also said that reducing the number of troops in the short term is NOT an option. \"Part of … the task here is making sure that Afghanistan is sufficiently stable so that we can make that hand off.

He replied, \"This decision will put us on a path towards ending the war.\"\n*** On Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: The president gave a tough response about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed when he was asked why some might be offended that a terrorist gets the same legal protections than an American citizen gets. \"I don't think it will be offensive at all when he's convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him.\" When pressed whether he was already prejudging the verdict, Obama replied, \"What I said was people will not be offended if that's the outcome.

      "Hello from Highways & Byways Ministries!\nWe haven’t posted in a while – but it isn’t because we aren’t working for the Lord. We have been singing, preaching, encouraging, and so much more. Each weekend, we sing at local nursing and assisted living homes and sometimes the hospital. It is a joy and honor to minister to and pray for our elders, who are often forgotten.\nOur teachers, preachers, Vets, and more are sitting in these places day after day, hour after hour – sometimes never having the privilege of a visitor. Their faces light up when we begin singing old songs they know and many of them sing right along with us!\nOur time has also been devoted to restoring and growing a church the Lord dropped right in to our lap: Redland Community Church.\nBorn in 1873, this precious old-fashioned church building was put together one log at a time by both the Baptist and Methodist, who joined forces to create a genuine community meeting place.\nThe current Board Members met and agreed to allow Highways & Byways Ministries to hold weekly services and take part in the maintenance and restoration of this precious old landmark church building.\nPictured below is my husband, Brother Stanley and me walking in to this mission head-on, with joy in our hearts.\nFollowing is some history from this site:\nThis church traces its history to 1873, when a small group of worshippers gathered together at Chinquapin Springs (one mile east) to build a community church. A small one-room log structure was completed on August 16, 1873, and was used by both Methodist and Baptist congregations.\nLand at this site was donated for church and school purposes by pioneer settler Hugh Blair. The log church at Chinquapin Springs was relocated here and used as a Union church and school. The Baptist and Methodist congregations continued to share the facility. Blair donated an adjoining acre of land in 1887 and a new frame sanctuary was built.\nThe Baptist congregation ceased using the Union church in 1906 when they moved to the Oak Flat community and built a new church (now known as Smyrna Missionary Baptist Church). After 1906 the Union church was known as Redlands Church and was occupied solely by the Methodist congregation.\nThe Methodist congregation disbanded in 1964 and the Redlands Church was purchased at auction by a group of former members.

      "- 1 What is Buckle Fracture\n- 2 Different types of Bone Fracture:\n- 3 Symptoms of Buckle Fracture\n- 4 Diagnosis for Buckle Fracture\n- 5 Treatment for Buckle Fracture\nWhat is Buckle Fracture\nBuckle fracture is also known as a torus fracture wherein it affects a side of the bone however it does not fully break although the side of the bone bends outward. The word “torus” comes from the Latin word “tori” which means swelling or what is called protuberance. This is a type of incomplete fracture which is often compared with the greenstick fracture where when one side of the bone breaks the other bends outward. However the difference with the two is that in buckle fracture it does not bow out.\nThis kind of fracture is usually common in children especially when the bones are growing. Compared with the adult fracture, the bones of a child are soft. This kind of fracture normally heals within a month or so however it is best to consult the doctor first before doing any treatment.\nX Ray Image 1 : A buckle fracture of the distal end of the radius.\nPicture source : wikipedia\nX Ray Image 2 : Buckle fracture\nPicture source : medical-definitions.com\nDifferent types of Bone Fracture:\nThis is a kind of fracture wherein there is a complete breakage of the bones or the bones cracked through and through. The breaks of the bones are often in straight lines.\nThe bones are broken up into smaller pieces and usually the fragments of the bones are unaligned.\nThese are also called as impacted fractures where the breakage of the bones is mostly secondary to the disease process. This is mostly related to problems like osteoporosis, running in long distance and others.\nIn this condition, the bone is not completely broken. It is also called as the greenstick fracture and small fissures are seen on the bones but it does not completely break.\nA kind of fracture here in the bone that is broken is exposed to the skin. The bone punctures or skin from the inside-out but then it retracts back. This is also called as the open fracture and the risks of infection are higher because bacteria, viruses and others can enter the punctured skin.\nBuckle fracture of the radius\nThis kind of buckle fracture is common in children where according to statistics about 50% of the child-related fracture cause is the radius buckle fracture. This is because children are carefree and they seem",
      "To the Esteemed Lord Vors,\nMy lord, as always it is good to hear from you. I fear I am both literally and figuratively wandering through unfamiliar territory with this mission, caught between freedom and responsibility in ways that are strange to me. I have little to guide me, save Kurik’s hard-headed wisdom and my own conscience, yet the burden of responsibility does not abate. The Swordlords may believe they have given me broad liberties in how I choose to go about fulfilling the dicates of their directives, however, I feel curiously ever the more constrained. I just wish to do right by everyone. Does not everyone deserve happiness? Who am I, then, to give it to them or to take it from them? Such are the problems I wrestle with of late. Even Iacobus I would not deny a fair chance at a good life; how much the easier it is to feel sympathy for a bandit, whose circumstances, sribed by fate, seeming by necessity may drive an otherwise simple man to a low sort of life, bereft of dignity and decency. Would not such a man wish to regain what he had lost, and legitimately, were the opportunity presented? My charter suggests (if not outright demands) application of “the rope or the sword” in cases of unrepentant banditry, after all. Thus, I thank you for your foresight in sending Thonolan. For such bandits as I am unwilling to slay outright, yet for whom I may have little trust, having Thonolan on hand as a rehabilitative option, with honest work, is nothing short of a blessing. I expect it will work out splendidly.\nThonolan himself is quite a nice fellow. A little rough around the edges, and perhaps a tad fatalistic, but he is quiet and well-mannered all the same. We are getting along rather well, I would say. You would scarce believe me, but the very day we set out from Oleg’s with Thonolan, we discovered an untapped gold mine! Or rather, we found a rather large gold vein within a large crack in the side of a hill, which could potentially become a gold mine. The gods work in mysterious ways, it would seem.\nIt would seem that I have traded one form of unpleasant politics for another. Since arriving in the Stolen Lands, I had come upon rivalry between a colony of mites and a tribe of kobolds that had them both riled up, to",

It soothes us with the false idea that, if we but mend ourselves, the scary people will leave us alone.\nThe real world is both darker than that and lighted brighter in places by surprising fires of nobility. It's darker because our enemies were not created by the peccadilloes of free people and will not melt away before a moral perfection that we, in any case, can never achieve. It's brighter because there are heroes like the FBI, the military and the cop on the corner who will give up everything, even their lives, to stop these madmen\nThat kind of rousing story seems tailor-made for films. So why aren't they telling it? It's not just about left and right, blue and red; it really isn't.

      "“Once a year we gather here, readying our sons and daughters for the final step of their growth to mature souls,” said the principal. “As you all probably already know, after each name is announced the student will come up, receive his diploma, along with the final assignment this school will give. Then we will announce whom they are the reincarnation of. Tonight we have an extraordinary class of reincarnates, led by none other than the great, now reborn, Arlist Moheggian!”\nBoth crowds came alive with a roar at this, whispering to each other and expressing their shock. “I can’t believe it.”…“Is he serious?” …”That’s horrible”…“Is this over yet?”… Which kid do you think it is?”…“I wonder if John will notice if I slip away and take a nap?”…“I’ll bet you $20 it’s that kid with that the glasses on the left there”…“Could it be me?”… “I bet its Jason, he’s so smart.”\nThe late Arlist Moheggian, who just a few years ago departed for Paresia, was perhaps one of the most famous people in all time; His deeds inspired everyone young and old. Arlist was born in the year 6314, or 44BC in Earth years. After attending his prep classes, his first assignment was a solid oak tree in a forest of South America. He stood for only two weeks before he was chopped down and used for wood as a raft. Despite his early failure, he went on to do great things. He was a respected farmer in Mesopotamia, a trader across the Sahara Desert. He was a general and emperor by the name of Julius, he fought in the crusades and later inherited a castle and a kingdom in western France. He served as a Pope, formed his own religion, and fled oppression in England. He led the Austrians for a while and served as President of the United States. He was a dog, a bird, and a fish. He was once an eagle soaring over Mexico, and once was a whale navigating the Pacific. He was a rhino in Africa, a lizard in the Amazon…the list goes on and on. His final task was of a professor of philosophy at Brown University, dying of old age in 1902 (Earth Years). After that, he retired to spend eternity in Paresia with Voxoo and other previously departed",
      "Northern Lehigh coach Joe Tout was happy not to be in West Catholic’s situation last week.\nCoach Brian Fluck’s Burrs had a bye after winning the District 12 championship on Nov. 20, with a 34-7 win over Edward Bok Vo-Tech.\n“I’m glad that we got to keep playing,” Tout said after the Bulldogs’ 50-14 rout of GAR in Friday night’s first-round state playoff game. “We got to stay in a rhythm.\n“It’s tough to keep kids focused at practice when you don’t have a game.”\nWest Catholic’s bye was created when District 2 didn’t conduct an eight-team tournament, as was expected when the PIAA bracket was created.

They’re a great defensive team, too. And so they played great. Toward the end that’s when we started picking it up. We talked about all week finishing, so that’s what we did. We finished out the end of the game, and we kept fighting the whole game. We never let up.”\nWhat does this moment feel like for you guys?\nKovacs: “It’s pretty good. It feels pretty good. And like Denard said, you have to tip your hat to those guys. Obviously they were struggling a little bit coming in, but we knew it was going to be a dogfight. That’s what the Michigan-Michigan State game is year in and year out. They have a tough defense. They pound the ball on offense. You have to tip your hat to them, but Michigan won today.”\nIs this defense good enough to win the Big Ten?\nKovacs: “We believe it, but at the same time, I think if we play like this every week we’re going to be in trouble. We have to keep getting better. That’s one of the things coach Hoke and coach Mattison emphasize: never become complacent. Get better every week. That’s what we plan on doing, and that’s what we’re going to do.”\nThe last defensive stand was sort of reminiscent of the last drive against Notre Dame. Did it feel like redemption or something similar to be able to get the stop this time?\nKovacs: “You know, that’s what I was thinking as we took the field. It’s our opportunity to redeem ourselves and give the offense the ball back. Same situation as Notre Dame, and today we executed. We stopped them when we needed to and made some big plays and got the offense the ball back and let Denard take over.”\nDrew Dileo was there every time you needed him.

      "A dragnet has been launched for a convicted murderer serving a 60-year prison term who was mistakenly released from a Chicago jail this week.\nSteven Robbins, 44, was convicted of shooting a man in 2002 in Indiana when the man tried to intervene in a fight Robbins was having with his wife. The dead man, Rutland Melton, scolded Robbins, telling him he should not hit a woman.\nAccording to documents from Marion County, Ind., Robbins walked to his car, pulled out a gun and shot Melton in the chest.\nRobbins was brought to Chicago to appear in court for an unrelated drug case, but when that case was dropped Robbins was released rather than being sent back to Indiana.\nThe Cook County Sheriff's Office has asked for the public's help in locating Robbins, a native of Gary, Ind. He is described as a black male, around 5-foot-5 and 190 pounds, with a tattoo on the right side of his neck that says \"Nicole.\"\nAccording to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, whose office launched an investigation into Robbins' release, the mistake \"appears to be a clerical error.\"\n\"In no way are we ducking responsibility,\" Dart said Friday. \"We're going to fix this.\"\nDart said the office's outdated paper system may be to blame.\n\"Because no paperwork had gone to the jail about him coming from Indiana, all the people in the records room saw was a guy whose court case was dismissed,\" he said. \"And so he -- like another 200 people a day we release -- was released ... out the front door of the jail.\n\"It's all a paper system,\" he added. \"And so when people start thinking it's maybe an inside job, the unfortunate reality is all these different detainees that we're dealing with every day -- and we move 1,500 a day -- the entire trail is a paper trail. It's not a computer message from the courtroom to the jail saying, 'Keep him for another 30 days or release him.' It's a piece of paper. We're not happy that it's that way. We've been trying to get it computerized, but it's not there.\"\nRegardless of the reasons, Pam James, public information officer for the Indiana State Prison, suggested the escape is a serious matter.\n\"We would consider any individual convicted of murder and escaped very dangerous,\" she said.\nShe added that Robbins likely did not have many possessions with him on",
      "Sunday, June 13, 2010\nSuper SMS: Pistachio Linzer Thumbprints and Chocolate Orange Macaroons\nIt’s cookie month for Sweet Melissa Sundays (every single recipe selected this month was a cookie recipe – fun) and I have a double post today. First up are Pistachio Linzer Thumbprints, which were last week’s selection. I made them on time, but didn’t get around to posting them last Sunday. I blame the season premiere of “The Next Food Network Star” being two hours long, if it had been its normal length, I would have been able to watch it, post, and get to bed at a decent hour. (Actually, we had a busy weekend in general, including a half-marathon in oppressive humidity and attending the first birthday party of a cute relative, so by Sunday night, flopping on the couch and watching reality television was an appealing activity.) Anyway, it had been reported on the Problems & Questions section that the dough was difficult to work with when cold. I made mine on Saturday and then let it sit out for about half an hour when I made the cookies on Sunday, before shaping the cookies and found it easy to work with.\nThough they ended up being a bit more work than a simple mix and scoop cookie (somehow I created quite a mess between rolling them in the pistachio crumbles and filling a pastry bag with jam), I thought they were fun to make and enjoyed the flavor combination. I also thought their rustic-look was quite charming. I was worried Josh wouldn’t like them, since he had told me he’s not big on pistachios, so I was pleasantly surprised when the half-batch I made disappeared in just a few days. He said he was happy he could surprise me with his gluttony. These cookies rated a 7 for Deliciousness and a 3.5 for Effort, for an EDR of 2. Tracey kindly helped out a fellow baker and hosted last week; you can find the recipe here on her site.\nMoving on to this week’s cookie: Chocolate Orange Macaroons. I made these last Sunday evening, another thing I did when I should have been posting, with intentions to bring them to my book club on Monday. Unfortunately, the macaroons did not turn out so well. As Melissa promised, it was a very simple recipe to put together – one bowl, no mixer! – but I ended up over-baking mine a bit. My",
      "Brother Branham established this ministry in 1965 as an outreach through which the Word would be spread abroad and the soon Coming of the Lord would be proclaimed. For decades, the William Branham Evangelistic Association has kept its sights focused on that guiding principle.\nHere is a brief look at the history of this vital agency through which the Gospel of the Kingdom has been made known around the world.\nIn July of 1965, Brother Branham asked for a meeting with Brother Roy Roberson, Brother Fred Sothmann, and his son, Brother Billy Paul Branham, who were members of the trustee board of the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville, Indiana. He described for them a new outreach he wished to establish, a branch of his Ministry that would operate separate from the local church. Its purpose would be to help finance evangelistic campaigns and support missionary endeavors around the world, without being a constant drain on the finances of the local assembly.\nAn Exposition of the Seven Church Ages\n, the first book that he had produced, was ready to be printed, and he was looking forward to eventually expanding his ministry’s outreach through the field of publications.\nIt took three months for an attorney to prepare and submit to the government the articles of incorporation for the\nWilliam Branham Evangelistic Association\n. In October, the three board members and Brother Branham signed the documents that would actually start the approval process.\nBefore there had been one journey planned, one event sponsored, or one effort funded, Brother Branham was called Home to be with the Lord.\nThe board members had a decision to make. Was there still a need for an evangelistic and missionary organization to sponsor the Ministry of Brother Branham? After careful consideration, the newly formed board made the decision to carry on with the original plans.\nThe final paperwork was registered in April of 1966. The missionary and evangelistic branches of William Branham’s Ministry were planted, and WBEA became the legal vehicle for the continuation of this life-giving, life-sustaining Message of the Hour.\nWBEA continues to publish and subsidize the distribution costs for nine of the oldest, and most requested, books relating to Brother Branham’s Ministry, including\nWilliam Branham, A Man Sent From God\nand the last book to be published before his passing,\nAn Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages\nA major part of our outreach today is the purchase of all the paper that is used for the printing of the Message at our Jefferson",
      "The Supreme Court laments that they spend most of their time in covering their back rather than in achieving their goals, writes M J Antony.\nPublic sector undertakings are often portrayed as sluggish mammoths hogging undeserved patronage of the state.\nWhen many of them are being dismantled or downsized, there are very few words spoken in sympathy with their plight.\nTherefore, when some kind words come from unexpected quarters, one is bound to listen carefully.\nIt was the Supreme Court itself that wrote a few pages on this subject in its recent judgment in the BSNL vs Telephone Cables Ltd case.\nThe case related to one of the disputes over the tender process adopted by PSU Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.\nThese days, if a government company floats a tender, litigation cannot be far behind.\nThey travel from the regulatory authority, its appellate authority, the high court and then the Supreme Court.\nWhether it is electricity, oil, spectrum, mining lease or any of the resources held in trust by the state, it is fiercely fought over at every stage.\nThe Supreme Court made its remarks in a case involving the tender procedure for inviting bids for polythene-insulated cables.\nThe dispute travelled three times to the Supreme Court in nine years and there was one attempt at arbitration.\nThe Delhi high court found that the procedure was not followed. It asked BSNL to redo the ratings for the competing bidders.\nIt even allowed the private company to sue for compensation. This led to another round of litigation.\nWhen the company found the going was not smooth, it called for arbitration. The Supreme Court cut the long story short by denying arbitration.\nIt is the BSNL's predicament during this long period which aroused the sympathy of the court.\nIt pointed out the 'vulnerable position' most PSUs find themselves in such situations. It said: \"More and more, they are subjected to vexatious litigation and other travails which other competitors in the private sector do not normally face.\nWhen public undertakings used to have monopoly and discharged public duties, control by the government and legislature and judicial review by the judiciary were an absolute necessity to safeguard public interest and ensure transparency and accountability.\nBut when public undertakings are required to compete with private sector, in commercial areas, controls by the executive and the legislature (sometimes referred to as political bondage) and judicial review of their action became a handicap which impedes their progress.\"\nPSUs' agony flows from their position in the Constitution. They are taken to be 'state'",

      "By Directorate of Foundation Programmes\n1.0 BRIEF HISTORY OF IJMBE\nThe Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination (IJMBE) is a national examination body approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria and fully certified by Nigeria University Commission (NUC) as an alternative to ‘A’ level Examination, for candidates who may wish to seek for undergraduate admission into Universities both in Nigeria and abroad. The IJMBE programme was envisioned as a stop-gap or bridge after secondary school education, which will prepare candidates academically, mentally and socially for the challenges of University education. The programme runs for a period of twelve (12) calendar months divided into two (2) semesters.\nIJMBE is under the control of a Governing Board – the Interim Joint Matriculation Board (IJMB) which was established in 1970. The Governing Board has the overall responsibility for taking policy decisions on the conduct of the IJMBE, and affiliating institutions for the purpose of running the IJMBE programme.\nThe IJMBE examination is based on an approved IJMBE syllabus which was produced by harmonizing the contents of the syllabus of the former Higher School Certificate (HSC), London GCE, Cambridge A – Level examination and the 100 level curriculum of Nigeria Universities. The syllabus is reviewed every five years in line with global changes.\nThe IJMBE is a qualifying examination conducted annually, mainly for Advanced Level (A/L) subjects for admission to 200 level (Direct Entry) in Nigerian and foreign Universities. Candidates for the examination are presented through affiliated institutions.\nThe institutions affiliated to the IJMBE programme cut across the different strata of tertiary education in Nigeria. These institutions are private, state and Federal institutions. Currently, there are over seventy (70) institutions including Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma spread across Nigeria affiliated to IJMBE programme.\nThe annual examination has been conducted consistently since the inception of the IJMBE under the control of IJMB Governing Board. The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has from 1978 been the moderating agency to IJMBE Examinations. JAMB moderates the questions and supervises the marking of the scripts through external moderators it recruits from Universities throughout the country.\n2.0 LIST OF IJMBE SUBJECTS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS\n2.1 LIST OF",
      "US-based Indian actor Freida Pinto, who found fame with the Oscar winning “Slumdog Millionaire”, says “strong female characters” are more important than female stars taking place of leads in films. She is glad the concept is re-emerging in Indian cinema.\nThere is a common thread that ties Freida’s films like “Slumdog Millionaire“, “Miral” or “Trishna” together and that is the presence of strong female characters.\nFreida opened up about the changes in Indian cinema during a session with director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and actor Anil Kapoor at the ongoing 17th edition of the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) extravaganza here.\nSince I don’t necessarily work in Bollywood, I can give you my views as a spectator about Indian films. There has been a great shift. When I was launching Girl Rising India last year, that’s when nine wonderful Bollywood stories came on board to tell stories about India.\nI feel with films like Priyanka Chopra‘s ‘Mary Kom‘, Kangana Ranaut‘s ‘Queen‘, I definitely feel that there will be more female protagonists taking over the lead and it has actually helped people understand on the grassroots level as well.\nHaving said that, Freida emphasised that it is the depth of the role that matters the most.\nIt is not just about female characters taking the lead in a film, but strong female characters also matter. My dad loved Shabana Azmi‘s work and Smita Patil’s films – these are strong women.\nI feel 1990s had a slight lack of (strong) female characters. I see resurgence of it now. Acceptance from audience makes it easier to make change at grassroots level. Definitely the change is happening.\nIn the short span of her career in the entertainment industry, this Mumbai-born girl has carved out a niche of her own in world cinema through her roles in films like “Slumdog Millionaire“, “Miral“, “Day of the Falcon“, “Immortals“, “Desert Dancer” and “Rise of the Planet of the Apes“.\nShe has also done her bit for society — be it aligning with a social cause like the “Girl Rising” campaign or getting together with female stars for a production house to solve the issue of gender disparity in Hollywood.\nThe actress says all her “life-changing experiences” started from India.\nMy social change and life experience also started in India in 2",

But over four decades, it has become more than an anchor in a new world. It is a monument to a lasting love.\n\"Isn't this the moat beautiful place in all Minneapolis, in all Minnesota?\" says Gisela Konopka, 76, gazing out at her well-tended half-acre from under a grape arbor. \"It's so peaceful! And these heavenly, beautiful trees! When we came hero there were no trees, nothing but a plank to the door. The steps were all broken. We built all this with our own hands.\"\nNearly 40 years ago, Berlin-born Konopka and her late husband Paul took a chance on a decaying cottage in a deteriorating neighborhood.\n\"We had a very unusual life before Minnesota,\" she says, seated in an outsized yellow porch warmed with orange and yellow '60s modern furniture. \"Preceding this it was a horror and eight years of constant moving.

      "Best Muscle Cars\nA Ford Falcon Beauty\nBy Mark Weisseg\nA friend of mine for many years owns this Falcon. For some reason he rarely drives it even though it runs and looks great. Dan has a gold one as well and it is as equally nice. He restored this car a long time ago, over thirty years ago at this stage. It’s only been about five years ago now he reconstructed his garage so he could put in an electric lift. He said we are just getting too old to be crawling around on our backs and using jack stands. The mechanics creeper has become our enemy at this stage of life so he made the move.\nThe car as we know it was the basis of the Mustang. Ford tried to make the Falcon its new hot sports car back in the day but the public already knew the Falcon name and history. It started out as boxy and landed up like this one. So, Ford was forced to come up with a new design and a new name. I hope FCA is taking notes now!\nAnyway, Dan loves this Falcon and all night long he was barraged with questions from the curious. Near the end of the night he floored me with one of those statements we all love to hear, ” Did I tell you about my Mustang?” Of course I said No and he whips out pictures of a 66 Mustang Fastback with a 289 in it. I got whoozy as I never caught wind of this one. Turns out it was a local find, parked in the back of the garage behind two other cars and was parked sideways. Dan bought it as soon as he saw it. No questions asked and he paid the asking price. As I am flipping through the pictures I can feel the blood returning to parts of my body in which we can not discuss. A 66 gold colored Mustang fastback? Right near us within 12 miles? So much for that BS that all to good cars have been found. He said he is going to start a full restoration that should take him 2-3 years. He is going to buy a rotisserie very soon for obvious reasons. I could not remember my name or what I drove there but I offered any and all assistance. I took down Dans new email address and said I would call him after the car show season as I want to go see this car. Dan lives about 5 miles from me.\nHow did he hear about the car? Well, he overheard two guys talking and like",
      "November 28, 2012\nMuch confusion exists regarding the efficacy, or lack thereof, of ginkgo for the enhancement of memory. Recently a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial assessed the utility of a standardized ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia and vascular dementia. A daily dosage of 240 mg GBE standardized to 24 percent flavonoids and 6 percent lactones was compared to placebo in 410 people over 50 years old with physician-diagnosed mild to moderate dementia.\nEach person had a caregiver to ensure compliance with the study and was followed over the 24 week study with a variety of validated questionnaires. Both cognitive performance (43 percent versus 23 percent) and quality of life (57 percent versus 39 percent) significantly improved in the GBE group compared to the placebo. Both the treatment group and the placebo group reported an approximately 40 percent chance of variable side-effects with the placebo group reporting a higher rate of severe side-effects. Results are both statistically, as well as clinically, very significant.\nMy commentary on this trial is meant to give you my anecdotal experience and approach to the use of GBE. First of all, yes, this is a proven herbal supplement with documented benefits in the treatment of mild dementia, memory loss affecting quality of life. This herb is safer, less expensive, and more proven than the drugs used for this condition and should be considered the standard of care in the first line treatment of dementia. My experience also emphasizes the importance of the Basic Nutritional Protocol (BNP –www.middlepathmedicine.com) in dramatically enhancing the effectiveness of GBE, and the importance of a caregiver in ensuring the compliance to any supplement routine as well as for validation of treatment effects.\nEven more importantly for the people out there who are not demented but notice mild cognitive impairment (MCI), I have found that GBE works best in combination with other supportive herbs. My treatment of choice for both MCI as well as early dementias of varied etiologies is a supplement called Membrin, made by OrthoMolecular.

      "Haute Enchilada’s unique café and gallery has plenty for the palate and the palette\nMoss Landing is a quaint historic fishing village that lies about 25 miles south of Santa Cruz. It is a treasure trove of places to explore, including fine antique stores, art galleries, lovely little shops, and is also home to the antique street fair that takes place annually on the last Sunday in July.\nHere is where you can go bird watching, whale watching, sailing, fishing, stock up on fresh seafood, or try the food at one of the area’s handful of restaurants. For a small town, Moss Landing certainly has a lot to offer. A friend and I rented a kayak there in the summer, and then went to the Haute Enchilada Café for lunch.\nMost people are more familiar with The Whole Enchilada, which lies in a very visible spot on the corner of Highway 1 and Moss Landing Road, but head down the road a few paces and you can’t miss its little sister café, the decidedly unique Haute Enchilada.\nSplashes of color greet you when entering the café and gallery—sexy hot pinks, azure greens and dazzling blues are a feast for the eyes, plus an abundance of wonderful artwork covers every wall. Proprietor Kim Solano has created a restaurant that not only serves fine food, but is also a beautiful gallery displaying local artists’ original work.\nOn a visit there for dinner recently, the restaurant’s vibe put me and my husband in a festive mood. He ordered a Cubano Mojito ($9.50) with Castillo rum, cucumber and lime, served with enough fresh mint to garnish several more mojitos, and he loves its fresh tang and hefty rum kick. For me it was a glass of local Alfaro’s Estate Pinot Noir ($14 a glass or $42 a bottle). Cocktails are a specialty of the Haute Enchilada, and they carry a good selection of tequilas. A fine array of coffee drinks is offered too, including a Salted Caramel Mocha, which is on my list for next time.\nThe café’s Soup Taster is a delicious delight of three soups—artichoke bisque, chicken tortilla with a red beet sauce, and poblano bisque with a hot and spicy kick—all imaginatively presented.\nMy Pescado Cubano (pistachio-encrusted snapper at $21), was fresh and tender",

      "Friday, December 28, 2007\n(Lithograph by Honoré Daumier(1808-1879)\nBusiness Times - 28 Dec 2007\nEvents in 2007 and in 2008 accentuating the trend\nBy LEON HADAR\nTHERE was a time - many years ago - when Time magazine was considered to be an American and international 'institution'. That explained why the world's movers and shakers paid a lot of attention to the individual that the founder Henry Luce and his successors picked as the magazine's Man of the Year.\nThat choice - basically announcing who was the persona that had the power to change the world - reflected the wisdom prevailing then among the political and corporate elites, located mostly in New York and Washington.\nBut gradually, Time magazine was transformed from that institution into the older and serious brother of People magazine, and now it has become, for all practical purposes, the Lenin Mausoleum of American journalism, an institutional corpse that is being preserved for some reason (prestige?) while People magazine, HBO and other media outlets keep the parent company in business.\nWhich leads one to ask: who really cares who or what Time selects as their person or 'thing' of the year? I certainly don't. But I'm nevertheless curious. Last year, the magazine opted for 'You' as the Person of the Year, rejecting the 'Great Man' theory of history according to which the powerful and the famous are the ones who shape our collective destiny as a species, and suggesting that instead in this age of globalisation it's 'You' - the individual consumer of information - that was taking control of political and economic events.\nThis year, Time, perhaps disappointed by the impact that 'You' seemed to have on our lives, decided to adopt a the traditional approach, and has selected a real person as its annual shaper of destiny - Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSo we seem to be regressing to the reactionary 'Great Man' theory of history. Mr Putin is expected to evoke the memories of such Russian historical giants as Peter the Great and Comrade Joseph Stalin.\nPersonally, I'm not as impressed with the new tough-talking man in the Kremlin. Yes, Russia with its huge energy resources and large territory and population is reasserting its influence as one of the world's great powers.\nBut it is not emerging as a major economic and military 'threat' to the US and it is",

      "Hello, my fellow Philadelphians. Good morning Council President Darrell Clarke, Council leadership, members of the City Council, labor leaders, union members, all elected officials, former Mayor Street and my fellow Philadelphians.\nIn the last five years, together, we have weathered crises, managed through hard times and set a foundation for a stronger, more diverse and prosperous City. And a growing Philadelphia, 9,000 new citizens, according to the latest Census Bureau report.\nToday, I want to talk about our future, not our past.\nBut through it all, we have depended on the resilience of our great citizens and on the dedication and hard-work of our public employees: like John Elfrey, Deputy Managing Director for the Office of Transportation and Public Utilities.\nJohn Elfrey is the 2013 recipient of the Richardson Dilworth Award for Distinguished Public Service. A true professional, John has spent almost three decades serving the City of Philadelphia. Please recognize John, who represents the many City employees committed to good government and excellent service.\nBefore I go any further, I know many of you here today are City employees with serious concerns. I have nothing but the deepest respect for the thousands of public employees who work on behalf of 1.5 million Philadelphians.\nYou want a fair contract and so do I. But a fair contract must balance the interests of both hard working taxpayers and dedicated City employees.\nInvesting in public employees requires reasonable pay increases and health care benefits, but we must also have work rule changes including overtime reform and the authority to better manage our workforce with an alternative to just layoffs ? not working for one day and coming back is better than not working at all.\nWe must also address the budget reality of a City Pension Fund that is only half funded and is taking more and more public resources that could be spent on citizen services or tax relief.\nThe pension changes we have proposed in contract negotiations will help preserve the health of the fund for the sake of current and future employees upon their retirement. Let me note here that we will soon announce a broker who will guide us through the process of the potential PGW sales and be paid only if a sale is completed. If that happens, the money we receive will largely go to shore up our employees' pension fund.\nToday, I can tell you that even though we still have serious challenges, the City's fiscal health is improving. We are projecting roughly a 3-percent increase in overall tax receipts.\nThe proposed FY14 General Fund budget",
      "Jeb Bush may have finally read the handwriting on the wall. Earlier in the year when it was revealed that James Baker was one of his foreign policy advisers supporters of Israel especially the Jewish ones recoiled and were worried that a Jeb Bush administration would echo his fathers as being anti-Israel (Baker is also an anti-Semite). This week Jeb said his brother Bush #43 was his top adviser on Israel matters and threw Baker under the bus.\nThe paradox for Jeb Bush is that thanks to his Secretary of State James Baker, his dad was arguably the most anti-Israel administration in history before Barack Obama. Baker was famous for scheduling a Middle East peace conference without inviting Israel (he told Congress if Israel wanted to object the Prime Minister had his phone number). Of the American Jews Baker famously said, “F**k the Jews they wont vote for us anyway.”\nOn the other hand next to Harry Truman who recognized the nascent Israel over the objections of his much more popular Sec. of State George Marshall, Jeb’s brother George W. was the most pro-Israel president in history.\nWith Jew-hating James Baker on Jeb’s team there was worry about who had Jeb’s ear on the Middle East.\nAs reported in the Washington Post\nThe question that led to Bush’s response was about how much he relied on former secretary of state James Baker…\nsaid that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his\nforeign policy team and then noted that one person he routinely looks\nto for guidance on Israel and related matters is his brother.\nalso expressed regret for the way he has unveiled his staff hires and\nlist of advisers and said the lengthy list he made public in February,\nwhich included Baker, was not an accurate representation of who he\nreaches out to when he’s considering Israel-related issues.\nAs to who the former Florida Governor relies on:\n“If you want to know who I listen to for advice, it’s him,” Bush said Tuesday, speaking to a crowd of high-powered financiers at the Metropolitan Club, according to four people present.\n(…) As he has explored a 2016 campaign for the White House, Jeb Bush has sought to create distance from the family political brand. While Bush has not criticized his brother, he rarely cites him as his guide on policies. And George W. Bush said last month that he planned to stay away from the campaign trail because voters do not like political dynasties.\nJeb Bush’s revelation that he regularly speaks with his brother about Israel also indicates that the siblings may be",
      "As you can see, we got out all our spotlights to examine a diversity of topics, people and locations for this issue of Insights. One of those topics is the impact of the UK’s impending exit from the European Union, both on higher education and scholarly publishing. Jacob Wilcock and Andrew Miller have provided us with an insightful and balanced summary of the issues and ask if a catastrophe for academia may be an opportunity for publishers.\nWe also spotlight four articles which explore aspects of user experience and library discovery. Leo Appleton calls on us to get physical (and digital). User experience (UX) is something of a buzz phrase, but Leo clearly explains how ethnographic methods enable librarians to look at their services afresh wholly from a user perspective. Donna Lanclos also talks about how ethnographic methods can help us tackle ‘the mess of academia’. She questions the value of the ‘one-stop shop’ solutions to discovery, pointing out we need to recognize the effectiveness of user practices which are spread across multiple tools and multiple places. We love the cognitive maps she has used in this article. Do take a look! Jeff Woods, Elizabeth Gillespie and Catherine McManamon from the University of Liverpool undertook a usability study to understand how library users were engaging with their resource discovery platform. Perhaps not surprisingly, they found that although 85% of users did make use of the discovery platform to some degree, ‘Google was the most popular choice’. Sarah Pittaway is engaging with students as partners at the University of Worcester to evaluate, develop and deliver their library services. One of the outputs of her project is Reffie the Raptor – have a look at the article and see whether you can spot him in our ‘#shelfies with Reffie’ photograph!\nJisc has turned its attention to the fundamental question of whether the institution as creator will help students by providing more affordable and relevant e-textbooks. In March we published an in-depth article by Frank Rennie, who explained how the University of the Highlands and Islands together with Napier University, as recipients of funding from this project, created two e-textbooks. In this issue, Vivien Ward provides a broader perspective, detailing the project’s findings from across all four of the institutions that participated by producing e-books specifically designed to meet the needs of their students.\nDeserving of limelight are two initiatives doing great and pragmatic work in tackling problems in scholarly communications. One of these, the Transfer Code of Practice, began under the auspices of UKSG, but is now the responsibility of",

      "Iran nuclear talks imperiled by dispute with Turkey\nREPORTING FROM WASHINGTON -- A war of words between Turkish and Iranian leaders intensified Thursday, threatening to delay or even scuttle a new round of talks between Iran and world powers, and raising fresh doubt about whether Tehran will bargain over its disputed nuclear program.\nOne day after Iranian leaders ruled out talks in Istanbul next week because of Turkey’s position on the Syrian uprising, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Iran of dishonesty.\n“It is necessary to act honestly,” Erdogan said at a news conference in Ankara, Turkey, according to Reuters. The Iranians “continue to lose prestige in the world because of a lack of honesty.”\nThe broadside marked a remarkable turnabout for Erdogan, who has worked hard for years to cultivate ties with Tehran. He has repeatedly taken Iran’s side in its dispute with the West over its nuclear development efforts.\nErdogan’s comments suggested that Iran, which has few allies on the nuclear issue, is becoming even more isolated. And it also points to how the growing unrest in Syria is dangerously splitting the Middle East.\nOfficials of the European Union, who are trying to set up the talks with Iran next week, said no decision has been reached on the date and place. A White House spokesman said the Obama administration views jockeying over the site as a “sideshow” and that the issue may still be resolved.\nBut some diplomats close to the issue acknowledged that the outbursts this week have made Istanbul an unlikely choice, and that it may be difficult to find another venue in time to meet the target date of April 13-14.\nSome diplomats said the dispute is the latest of many signs that the Iranian government is in no mood to give ground on the nuclear issue, despite growing pressure from economic sanctions and the threat of Israeli military strikes.\nAlthough Iran said in a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton that it is ready to discuss the program, Iran has shown little other indication that it is ready to cooperate. It has continued to resist pressure from the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog agency to provide more information on its nuclear sites.\nIran has suggested several other possible meeting sites, including Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus, Syria, and China. But China has been reluctant, and diplomats said Baghdad, Beirut and Damascus are unlikely choices because of security issues. Another possibility is Geneva, where talks were held in 2009.\nCancellation of this round of talks would not be totally unexpected. Many diplomats have been pessimistic about the prospects for this round",
      "SOUTH BEND It began with the usual bouquets and hugs for departing seniors Megan Duffy and Courtney LaVere, but they dispensed with the artificial sweetener soon enough. Senior Night, hold the sugar, with extras on elbows. Notre Dame needed to win its last game at the Joyce Center to avoid the indignity of playing another one here in the NIT. It would take more than a few packets of Equal for this team to swallow that. So urgency bordering on desperation during Tuesday's game drowned out the emotional farewell that preceded it. \"More than anything else,\" LaVere said, \"we knew we just really needed to win this game.\" Jason Kelly Commentary It looked like the jayvee game before one of the olden-day encounters. Two proud teams trying to \"out-don't\" each other. Imagine how the kids must feel, watching the local television feed and wondering why all those tall guys keep falling down. Indiana's Sean Kline was whistled for a foul for backing into Purdue's Gary Ware. But Kline didn't appear to gain an advantage. He just looked like he was settling into a lumpy beanbag. As Bryant Dillon nursed the clock in the first half, biding his time to manufacture one last Boilermaker shot, he scooped the ball instead of dribbling it. That's a carry, a rare old violation that seldom interrupts the rhythm of the modern game. Not once, but twice -- Indiana had one too -- that endangered call brought a premature end to a possession. Hoosiers-Boilermakers, circa 2006: Making the carrying violation relevant again. Indiana won 70-59, by the way, streaking away in the final minutes, making up for all the missed shots along the way that made it interesting on the scoreboard. On the court, interesting would be the wrong word to describe it. Just because the game stayed close until Marshall Strickland and Robert Vaden lit Indiana's offensive torch didn't make it dramatic. With the score tied at 30 in the second half, Purdue's Matt Kiefer launched a 3-point attempt that glanced off the rim. His coach Matt Painter doubled over on the sidelines, like his dinner didn't agree with him. Almost before 14,038 fans at Mackey Arena finished groaning along with him and turned their heads to the other end, Indiana threw a pass and the potential momentum swing away. It continued in that vein",
      "So, how could I resist when this Classic Chalk popped onto my screeen in the middle of the August doldrums?\nJust what every Classics Prof. has ever wanted: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian chalks!\nDo you scratch on the blackboard (if such a thing still exists) with sticks of Greek and Roman columns, shifting from severe unadorned Doric for Plato, perhaps, to red Corinthian for the mad Emperor Elagabalus?\nThis is the perfect problem to consider during the Dog Days.\nWhy Dog Days?\nThe Dog Days originally were the days when Sirius, the Dog Star, rose just before or at the same time as sunrise -- which no longer happens due to the procession of the equinoxes. But it is still the hottest, driest time of year in most of the northern hemisphere, a time of torrid, sultry weather, when bloggers slow down or even stop blogging.\nSirius is the brightest star in Canis Major (left) and rose and set with the sun in summer, roughly from 20th July to mid-August. The star is so bright that, under the right conditions, it can be seen by the naked eye even in daylight.\nThe Greeks believed that the heat of late summer was actually caused by the appearance of Sirius and called this period the days 'under [the] Dog' (hupò Kúna). To Hesiod (Works & Days, 8th C BC), the star brought the enervating heat that led to inactivity and lethargy in men (when men are feeblest) but women -- ever devious -- were at their most wanton and ran riot.\nFour hundred years later, the Latin poet Aratus (ca. 310-260 BC), depicted Sirius as bringing a dangerous scorching heat that burns and wilts the crops. It was bad for humans, too. Sirius produced 'emanations', you see, which placed people and animals in dire danger. The star shot out flaming tongues of fire and deadly fevers. People who suffered from its heat were said to be 'struck by the star' (astrobóletus).\nThe Romans believed that Sirius was adding heat along with the sun to make it super-hot, thus scorching the earth. And thus, Sirius and the \"Big Dog\" constellation (Canis Major) came together with the hottest summer days, called the caniculares dies, the days of the",
      "Planned Parenthood has been the subject of multiple tragedies over the past couple of weeks. First, there was the mass shooting at a clinic in Colorado Springs on Nov. 27, an act of domestic terrorism by a man who used the phrase “no more baby parts” to explain his actions to law enforcement officials. Then, a few days ago, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a bill defunding the organization.\nDespite the fact that many feel the hateful rhetoric on the far-right, the misrepresentation of Planned Parenthood is at least partially to blame for the shooting and other countless acts of violence against the organization.\nPlanned Parenthood is not an evil organization. It’s not even close. The GOP’s main problem with it is that it provides abortions, which are legal. Besides, abortions take up about 3 percent of their total resources and are not paid for with federal funds.\nBy defunding Planned Parenthood the Republicans are defunding one of the nation's leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for women, men and young people. They are defunding an organization that provides critical cancer screening and prevention (nearly 400,000 Pap tests and nearly 500,000 breast exams each year). Planned Parenthood provides nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections every year. They are especially critical to people with low income who cannot afford other health care providers.\nFrankly, it’s a bit rich that the political party criticizing Planned Parenthood for “killing babies and selling their parts,” not actually what they do, is heavily financed and favored by groups such as the NRA. If they were really pro-life, you’d think that they’d be in favor of background checks and other restrictions on items whose sole purpose is to kill people, especially seeing as we have had more mass shootings this year than calendar days.\nBut sure, the group that primarily works to prevent unintended pregnancy and cancer is evil while the one that wants to give guns to everyone is our best friend. Makes perfect sense.\nIf Republicans don’t want abortions to occur then they should really increase funding to Planned Parenthood. Here’s why. About 35 percent of their services go towards contraceptives. Contraceptives such as birth control help prevent unplanned pregnancies, 40 percent of which end in abortions. One Guttmacher Institute study found that federal funding for family planning and other critical health care services for low-income and uninsured people prevented 345,000 abortions in 2013.\n",
      "My last post looked at the effect of temperature on home field advantage. We saw that cold weather put dome and warm climate teams at a disadvantage. The post was titled How Does Temperature Affect Road Teams?, but I really didn't answer that question. I measured the size of the effect, but I didn't solve the riddle of actually how temperature makes a difference. This post will begin to look at just how weather makes a difference, starting with the passing game.\nHere's how passing fares for home and visiting teams by temperature. The chart below shows Adjusted net Yards Per Attempt (AYPA), which accounts for sacks and interceptions, according to temperature. Keep in mind there are smaller sample sizes at the extremes.\nHome teams have an advantage across the temperature spectrum, which appears to be exaggerated at extreme temperatures. This chart included playoff games. In the last post, commenter Matt pointed out that very cold games are disproportionately playoff games, which would bias the numbers in favor of home teams. This bias is due to the fact that better teams are usually seeded higher and therefore usually at home. I removed playoff teams and the difference between home and visitor AYPA below 30 degrees is actually slightly bigger. The visitor AYPA is virtually the same, but the home AYPA is about 0.2 or 0.3 yards per attempt higher than this chart above shows.\nThe big takeaway should be that temperature does in fact hurt the passing game. Does it hurt dome and warm climate teams more than others? The chart below tells the tale. It's noisier than we'd like, but one thing we can tell is that the colder the weather the lower the passing efficiency for all types of team climates. Keep in mind there are very few games in the extreme bins, only a total of 36 games in the 11-20 degree bin, and only 15 games in the 91-100 bin.\nI wouldn't be too quick to dismiss the drop off in passing numbers in the 91+ degree bin. It's not statistically significant, but with more data it may appear to be a real effect.\nI always thought that it was really wind that affected the passing game the most, and not temperature. They often go hand-in-hand in places like Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo, so it's difficult to parse them apart. Here is AYPA according to wind speed. It's actually the minimum wind speed reported in the official gamebook. Often, the game",
      "Despite the endless selection of eateries (which ranges from first-timer cafes to famous chain restaurants) at the Pavilion, the 2 most celebrated ones were definitely J.CO Donuts & Coffee and The Loaf.\nSince time was limited, we decided not to join in the infinite queue to get the donuts and headed to The Loaf instead.\nThough the queue was not as long as J.CO's, this compact bakery was also doing quite a brisk business. Despite the simple interior design, the arrangements of pastries and cookies were very \"appetising\" (to me at least). The usage of cardboard trays to place the bread added sophistication to the whole experience.\nDespite all these and the background of this bakery, the main question still remains: Were the food good?\nSince the stomach was still hard at work, we decided to have mercy on it by selecting just a few freshly baked buns. Just to confirm what the hype was all about.\nThe Fuwa Fuwa Toast or French Toast (RM3) which was lightly dusted with icing sugar tasted rather bland. The egg (and I presume milk) coating did not provide sufficient aroma and taste to the toast. I've always preferred my toast thin and crispy. The Loaf's version was thick and chewy. Freshness aside, the combination of thick and bland toast was not attractive.\nWe also had the Chicken Ham and Cheese Bun (RM4.80), which tasted rather ordinary. The ham was firm and flavourful but the cheese (which is an important component here) did not enhance the flavour of the bun. For the price, I was expecting higher (or at least more flavourful) grade of cheese.\nLastly, the Caramel Walnut Bun (RM3.60). When I chose this, I was expecting a burst of caramel and walnut flavours as I take my first bite but I was wrong. The ensemble tasted rather bland and the amount of crushed walnuts in the bun was unimpressive. It's not difficult to make the bun tasty. Just add more caramel and walnuts. Less is not always more.\nIncluding a bottle of San Pellegrino (RM10) and a cup of coffee (RM4.80), the bill came up to RM27.51.

      "The Assyrians were fierce warriors whose kingdom was upstream on the Tigris River from the Babylonians. Their armies conquered Babylon in 911BCE and over the next three centuries, the Assyrians built the largest and powerful empire the world had known at that time.\nBy the seventh century BCE, Assyrian armies seized lands stretching from Egypt in the west, across Mesopotamia to Persia in the east. The Assyrians ruled over their empire with great cruelty, forcing cities to pay tribute. Tribute is payment for protection. The tribute from throughout the region made Assyrian warriors rich. The wealth also allowed the Assyrians to invest in military technology that made their armies even more fearsome.\nIron swords, lances and armor strengthened the Assyrian army because iron weapons were stronger than the bronze weapons used by other civilizations of that era. The Assyrians also used iron to create powerful battering rams. In its most simple form, a battering ram is a large, heavy log carried by several men and propelled with enough force to break down city walls. The Assyrians added wheels and canopies to their battering rams. A canopy is a small roof that protected Assyrian soldiers from rocks and spears thrown down at them by defensive forces standing atop city walls.\nThe invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots. This allowed Assyrian archers to shoot arrows from the chariot and escape before opponents had the opportunity to counter-attack. Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000BCE, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry. A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.\nThe Assyrian cavalry was also better outfitted for war, with chain mail and leather boots. Chain mail is a type of armor consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. While other armies fought in sandals, leather boots protected Assyrian soldiers while they were around horses, and prepared the Assyrian army to fight in rough terrain and in cold weather, rain and snow.\nSoon after the death of the warrior king Assurbanipal in 627BCE, widespread revolts toppled the Assyrian Empire. Babylon recaptured Mesopotamia under the rule of their warrior king, Nebuchadnezzar. Mesopot",
      "BAY CITY (WWJ/AP) – Bay City has declared a water emergency. Officials are searching for the source of a water main break that’s draining 10 million gallons of water a day.\nBut Emergency Management Coordinator Ryan Manz says the city shouldn’t run out of water if people are conservative about their water use.\n“We have high confidence that if residents of Bay County pitch in and adhere to the water use restrictions, that we should be able to get through this together,” said Manz.\nResidents and businesses are being asked to avoid all unnecessary water use.\n“Residential water-use should be limited to the amount necessary to sustain life through drinking, food preparation and personal hygiene,” he added.\nThe city provides water to most of Bay County.\nCrews discovered Saturday there was a major water main break, officials said. Public works Director Dave Harran has said the city’s water reserves could be empty Monday unless the location of the leak is found and crews can halt it.\nOn Sunday, the city said it was taking in water from the Saginaw Bay at a greater rate than the leak was discharging water.\nThe search for the break has been extensive. Firefighters from neighboring townships drove Bay County roads in the hopes of finding flowing water. A state police helicopter surveyed farm fields and farmers were asked to check their fields for any unusual water. Crews also have been inspecting water mains that run under the Saginaw River to see if any of them is the source of the leak.\nUnder the water-use emergency, residents are asked to avoid unnecessary water use, including laundry, watering lawns and washing cars. Residents are also being asked to cut down on using water for personal hygiene.\nOperations continued Sunday at some businesses that use water, including the downtown Totally Clean Coin Laundry.\n“I guess it didn’t faze me at all,” said Savana West, who was in the middle of doing her laundry. “If we are going to run out of water … I’m going to need clean clothes for the rest of the week.”\nAll Bay County residents are affected by the water emergency except residents in the city of Auburn, the village of Linwood and Frankenlust Township. Bay County residents who live in the Midland city limits aren’t affected.\nTM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "Celebrating Tambos' legacy\nTomorrow, the final resting place of struggle stalwarts Oliver and Adelaide Tambo will be declared a national heritage site as part of the OR Tambo Month commemoration in the City of Ekurhuleni.\nThe two are buried side by side at the Tamboville Cemetery in Wattville, south of Benoni.\nMondli Gungubele, executive mayor of the municipality, speaking ahead of OR Tambo Month in the Germiston council chambers said: \"Such was the stature of Tambo that his legacy led to the realisation of the principles of fighting for a democratic, nonracial and nonsexist South Africa.\n\"It is therefore fitting that the municipality resolved to confer the Freedom of the City of Ekurhuleni to Tambo and even went on to declare October, which is Tambo's birthday month, Oliver Tambo Month — a time in which we remind ourselves about the life and legacy of this revered elephant of the struggle for liberation.\"\nFormer president Nelson Mandela said at Tambo's funeral in 1993 that he was a giant, who strode the globe like a colossus.\nOliver Reginald Tambo was born on October 27 1917 in Kantolo in Mbizana in the Eastern Cape. He attended school in Johannesburg, and studied at Fort Hare University. In 1944, Tambo, Mandela, Walter Sisulu and others formed the ANC Youth League.\nIn 1954 he was elected acting secretary general of the ANC.\nIn 1955 he became secretary general of the ANC and was charged with high treason along with 155 others. The charges were dropped in 1957. He became ANC deputy president in 1958, holding the position until 1967 when he was elected ANC president.\nTambo went into exile in 1960 following the Sharpeville massacre.\nIn 1974 the ANC was recognised by the United Nations as a truly representative liberation movement.\nTambo was re-elected ANC president at the Kabwe conference in 1985 and in 1986 the United States Congress imposed official sanctions against South Africa. Tambo suffered a brain spasm in 1988.\nIn 1990, he returned from exile on December 13. He became chancellor of the Fort Hare University in 1991.\nHe passed away April ",
      "Professor, DJ, and journalist Michael Stock takes music-nerd obsessiveness to new levels. In 1999, when researching a film about Joy Division leader Ian Curtis, he not only interviewed members of such late-'70s bands as New Order, Crispy Ambulance, and A Certain Ratio, he also talked to their ex-girlfriends and widows. And then, while writing the script for what would eventually morph into Control (albeit without his stated involvement), he refused to listen to any music made after May 18, 1980, the day Curtis hanged himself.

      "And my experience with curtains has been limited to straight, rectangular panels, so I was forced to wing it this time.\nIt turned out like this:\nNot too bad! It's not exactly how I had pictured it, but it'll do. I'm actually pretty proud of myself, though the process of getting there was slightly comical (not to mention slow and tedious). I took a leap of faith, and photographed each step along the way -- just in case it wasn't a complete disaster in the end. The process went something like this:\nI determined that the width of a roll of waxed paper would be about right for the height of the valance (so scientific!), and cut a piece double the width of the window (72\"). Then I marked the halfway point and attempted to draw a gentle curve on one side. Next, I folded the whole thing in half and cut on my line.\nNot such a gentle curve after all.\nBut with a little more trimming it looked passable to me.\nThen I fan-folded the whole thing and taped it up to my window to see how it would hang.\nThat didn't look quite right, so I flattened it out a bit, trimmed off some more and tried it again.\nBetter. Now I had a big piece of fan-folded wax paper, impossible to lay flat for cutting. So I folded the whole thing in half, wax sides together, and ironed it -- melting it into one very stiff hunk of pattern. But it was flat. Next, I pinned the bulkiest pattern ever used on the fold of my lining and fabric (folded end-to-end) and cut it out. I had to piece my prints first, because I didn't quite have two yards of either one. Funny I never thought to check that before.\nNext I marked a new curve line on the pattern for the top layer of the valance. This is where I wish I had only gone two or maybe three inches shorter. I went four.\nRepeated the cutting process with the second print and lining.\nNext, I pinned both print pieces to the lining pieces, wrong sides together, and sewed the sides and bottom (1/4\" seam), leaving the long, straight, top edges open.\nTurned both pieces right side out and pressed.\nNext, I pinned the two layers together at the top, in reverse order of how they would hang. The shorter top layer behind the longer bottom layer.\nI stitched the top together with a 3/8\" seam, then",

      "Tigran Petrosian (1929-1984) - World Chess Champion from 1963 to 1969\n\"One must beware of unnecessary excitement.\"\nLife and Chess Career\nTigran Vartanovich Petrosian (or Petrosyan) was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, on 17th June, 1929. He learned chess from his parents when he was eight, and won some local tournaments as a junior. After both his parents died in World War II when he was 16, he moved to Erevan, Armenia on his own and won the Armenian championship in 1946 and 1948. In 1949 he moved to Moscow and continued to win tournaments, winning the Moscow championship in 1951 and taking second place in the USSR championships that year behind Paul Keres.\nHe continued to excel throughout the 1950's, finally winning the USSR title in 1959 and then again in 1961. He won the privilege to play Mikhail Botvinnik, the reigning World Champion, by taking first place at the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Curacao (ahead of no less a player than Bobby Fischer, who later claimed that the Soviet Bloc players had conspired against him by sharing their analysis). He defeated Botvinnik, who was by then a spent force in chess, in a match of five wins, fifteen draws and two losses. He defended his title three years later against Boris Spassky and won narrowly, but Spassky beat him second time around in 1969.\nHe tried to come back and win the championship a second time in 1971, but this time he was destroyed by the then-unbeatable Bobby Fischer, who went on to beat Spassky in the highest-profile chess match of all time. Petrosian played tournament chess strongly during the 1970s and early 1980s despite the loss of his title, until illness overcame him and he died of cancer on August 13th, 1984.\n\"It was really hard to play Tigran. The thing is that he had a somewhat different understanding of positional play. He went deeper into it than usual and even I did not fully understand Tigran’s way and depth of judgment.\"\n- Mikhail Botvinnik\nPetrosian is",

      "Women will soon be able to serve in all positions in the United States military -- including combat -- if they meet the demands of the job.\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter announced the policy change Thursday at the Pentagon -- the headquarters of the military near Washington, D.C. Carter said the branches of the military -- Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard -- must tell him by January how they plan to fulfill his order.\nCarter’s plan is not without critics.\nJoseph F. Dunford Jr. was the top general in the Marine Corps. While he was Commandant, he pointed to studies showing that military units that include women are not as effective as all-male units.\nDunford is now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- the nation’s top military officer -- and will be required to put Carter’s order into effect.\nReporters asked Carter repeatedly if Dunford supported his decision. Carter said “my decision is my decision.” He said he expects the general will put the new policy in place. The United States has a long history of strong civilian control of the military.\nAfter almost three years of study, almost all of the services told Carter that women who meet the standards of a job should be able to be placed in any position. But the Marine Corps asked that women continue to be banned from some positions -- including infantry.\nCarter refused. He said “there will be no exceptions.” Now, he noted, qualified women will be able to “drive tanks … and lead infantry units into combat.”\nHe said he does not believe letting women hold combat jobs will hurt the effectiveness of military units.\n“To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half” of the country’s population, he said. He said it is time to “harness the skills and perspectives that women have to offer.”\nWomen had been able to work in about 90 percent of the military’s jobs. Because of Carter’s decision, they will be able to fill all remaining 220,000 positions.\nThe military has gradually accepted women in positions that were once held only by men. In 1975, it opened its military academies to women. In 1993, it let women fly fighter jets and serve on combat ships.\nAnd, as Carter noted, women have been forced to engage in combat to defend themselves in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nI’m Christopher Jones-Cruise.\nChristopher Jones-Cruise reported this story from Washington.

      "OTTAWA — The House of Commons sent the Harper government’s budget legislation to the Senate Monday night, bringing the 425-page bill one step closer to rewriting dozens of Canadian laws for environmental protection, old age security payments and employment insurance.\nFederal MPs voted 157-135 to adopt the legislation at third reading, one of its final obstacles before becoming law.\nForeign Affairs Minister John Baird said Parliament has gone through an “unprecedented” debate about the budget and its supporting legislation, and that the government was prepared to continue.\n“We sat for more than a full day, 24 hours, discussing, debating and voting on the bill just last week,” Baird said, a few hours before the vote.\n“What we cannot debate is the reality is that this government is on the right track when it comes to the economy. The prime minister, right now, is meeting with world leaders and they all look to Canada as an island of stability. That has happened because of the fiscal measures taken by this government and we are very proud of it.”\nFederal Liberals have been vague about whether they will let the legislation sail through the Senate, but the NDP made a last-minute attempt to prevent passage in the Commons, proposing an amendment to deny third reading to the bill on the argument that Parliament does not have enough details about the impact of $5.2 billion in budget cuts.\nThe amendment followed a legal opinion posted by the Parliamentary Budget Office Monday morning that argued federal departments were shirking legal requirements by not providing details of federal spending changes.\nThe NDP tabled the amendment early in final debate on the bill, but it failed to stop the vote from proceeding on what the opposition party calls a “Trojan horse.”\n“We’re using every tool in our tool box and the reasonable amendment is one more,” NDP finance critic Peggy Nash said Monday afternoon.\n“It makes no sense for parliamentarians to vote on this budget without knowing what these cuts mean.”\nThe Commons historically has never approved such an amendment on third reading.\nThe opposition parties, with the help of Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, held up passage of the bill Thursday by forcing nearly 24 straight hours of consecutive votes on more than 800 proposed amendments.\nSenate Liberals will have to decide whether they also will use procedural tools to hold up passage.\nThe decision for the Liberals — who form the opposition in the Senate, where the Tories have a majority — will rest on whether they feel the opposition made its point last week in the Commons.\nA final decision isn’t expected to",
      "I have been looking forward to this Pane Siciliano for months, but for some reason just couldn’t get it started. Perhaps it was the knowledge that this particular bread takes three days to complete. Even though I knew that most of the allotted time would be dedicated to waiting for the dough to ferment and didn’t require any extra effort, I was still intimidated. It’s hard for me to plan things one day in advance, much less three days in advance! But I finally did it. And yes, this golden-hued bread was worth the wait. It was as delicious as it was beautiful.\nLike the Pain de Campagne before it, this bread starts with a pâte fermentée, a small batch of dough that is made the day before the main batch of dough gets put together. So on the first day, you just need to make a quick batch of pâte fermentée and put it in the refrigerator to ferment overnight. I used the stand mixer for that part.\nThe second day, take the pâte fermentée out of the fridge and cut it into small pieces. Cover it with a towel and let it sit at room temperature for an hour or so.\nMeanwhile, get ready to mix up the dough. Put the dry ingredients (flour, semolina, instant yeast and salt) into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. I decided to mix this one by hand.\nNext, add the rest of the ingredients: water, olive oil, honey, and the pieces of pâte fermentée.\nMix vigorously with a wooden spoon or with the paddle attachment on your stand mixer until you have a shaggy, slightly sticky ball of dough. As usual, if the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. If it’s too dry, or if there is still flour left in the bowl after mixing, add a bit more water.\nIf you are using a stand mixer, switch to the dough hook for kneading. If not, dump the dough out onto a floured work surface to knead by hand.\nKnead the dough by hand for about ten minutes (6-7 minutes in a stand mixer) until smooth and supple.\nAt this point it should pass the windowpane test. Mine didn’t. I kneaded it for another minute or so then just moved on.\nNow it’s time to let the ball of dough rise until doubled in size. The book says to let it ferment at room temperature for about two hours. My apartment was pretty warm, so I had",
      "Why is North Korea's Kaesong industrial park closing?\nThe exceptional length of the shutdown so far could signal that inter-Korean relations have entered a new low.\nJean H. Lee/AP/File\nSeoul, South Korea\nNorth Korea “will temporarily suspend operations in the zone and examine whether it will allow its (continued) existence or close it,” said Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee secretary Kim Yang-gon, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. The KNCA blamed the suspension on aggressive behavior by South Korea, which it said was trying to \"turn the zone [Kaesong] into a hotbed of war.\"\nObservers are now trying to gauge the motivations behind North Korea’s announcement amid heightened tensions.\n\"It's one of two things,” says Daniel Pinkston, North East Asia deputy project director for the International Crisis Group (ICG) in Seoul, South Korea. “It’s either part of a coercive bargaining game meant to pressure external actors, or it’s part of internal coalition building,” though he stressed the first was more likely.\nOn April 3, North Korea barred South Koreans from entering the complex and hasn’t allowed new workers from South Korea into the industrial park since. The complex has been closed before for short periods, most recently in 2009, but this is the longest interruption to regular in-and-out traffic. The exceptional length of the shutdown and North Korea’s pledge to pull out could signal that inter-Korean relations have reached a new low.\nNorth Korea has a clear incentive to keep the joint economic zone open. The industrial park produced $470 million worth of goods last year, and North Korea earned about $80 million from the complex in 2012, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Unification.\nIn addition to its economic importance, Kaesong has been a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation since it opened in 2004. It was designed as a mutually beneficial arrangement that would provide an example of how North and South Korea stand to gain from working together. Should it be closed down permanently, the large cluster of factories sitting unused, or occupied by new tenants, would vividly illustrate just how much inter-Korean relations have deteriorated.\nKaesong is also one of the few connections to the outside world for North Korea, often referred to as a “hermit kingdom.” The North Koreans who work at Kaesong are the most likely to get the chance to interact with businessmen from South Korea.

My real involvement in local politics began when I, by accident rather than design, became the lead campaigner in the “Save Thorndon Park” campaign in Winter 2005. It was through this that I realised that I was capable of standing up for a cause and for others and I felt that standing for council was the right thing to do.

      "MOUNT NEBO, Jordan (CNS) — The Memorial of Moses on Mount Nebo has reopened its doors to the public amid festivities, after nearly a decade of restoration.\nBelieved by ancient tradition to be the site where Moses saw the Promised Land and died, a church and monastery are perched atop this 3,300-foot rugged mountain facing the northern end of the Dead Sea. It has drawn Christian pilgrims throughout the centuries and is considered one of the most important pilgrimage, tourist, and archaeological sites in Jordan and the Holy Land.\nCardinal Leonardo Sandri, the special envoy of Pope Francis and prefect of the Congregation for Eastern Churches, said he was thrilled to officiate at a place of great spiritual significance to Jews, Muslims and Christians alike.\n“The spiritual treasures that this place holds today are returned to Jordan and to humanity,” Cardinal Sandri told an Oct. 16 gathering of some 500 dignitaries, including Jordanian Tourism Minister Lina Annab, Bedouin leaders, foreign diplomats and top Catholic officials in the Middle East.\nExcavations led by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land, which acquired the area in 1932, have uncovered significant remains of an early basilica — built in 597 on fouth-century church foundation — and Byzantine mosaic pavements. However, a simple structure sheltering these important finds was crumbling and needed to be replaced to protect the treasures it housed.\n“I am very happy to represent here the Holy Father Francis and to be in the place of Moses when he received only the vision of the Promised Land,” Cardinal Sandri told the Catholic News Service as he viewed a sunset of purples and reds in the direction of Jerusalem.\n“We are always walking to the Promised Land of peace, fraternity, justice, freedom for all the world in the name of Jesus Christ,” he added, as a pale, full moon rose over the other side of the mountain, transforming the place of prayer into a magical vista.\nConveying Pope Francis’ words to the gathering, Cardinal Sandri commended Jordan for protecting precious religious and historic antiquities at a time when they have been ruthlessly destroyed in neighboring Syria and Iraq. He also praised the Arab kingdom for providing safety to refugees from war-ravaged lands.\n“The kingdom of Jordan has become, in recent years, a place of welcome, hospitality, and healing for thousands of refugees and exiles,” Cardinal Sandri said.\nHe urged the international community to",

      "Earlier this month I took the kids out of school in order to see Kirk Cameron’s documentary, “Unstoppable”, at a theater not-so-near to us. My sister and niece joined us to make the three-hour round trip because we had seen the trailer (watch it above) and thought it would be worth the time and expense. It was.\nKirk Cameron has said of this film, “this is the most personal project I have ever made regarding my faith”. It was prompted by the death of a close family friend and in it, he seeks to tackle the monumental questions, ‘Why do bad things happen to good people?’ and ‘Why does God allow evil in this world?’ The kind of questions all people of conscience ask at some point in their lives. Kudos to Kirk for his integrity, inspiration and strength in creating a documentary that rips across the current of feel-good, shallow secular humanist films that are typical of Hollywood.\nThe film wasn’t exactly what I expected, but yet I wasn’t disappointed either. I had expected more interviews and insights from others, but this is very much Kirk Cameron’s take on Holy Scripture, beginning with a recreation of Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden. This was well done, discreet and thought provoking; I was given pause to consider how Adam may have viewed the earth in those first days. The depiction was even more beautiful as Eve beheld Adam for the first time. As a side note, I thought how this imagery is missing from modern films -- the notion of subtlety vs. explicit images, of male, female and agape love.\nThe youngest of our crew is in 6th grade and, although this film is unrated, it does contain some graphic scenes relating to Eve’s creation and the murder of Abel that may be disturbing for a young audience. In fact, the brutality of Cain is my only criticism of the whole documentary. I thought the scene of Abel’s death was too long and gruesome... but then again, perhaps the idea was to emphasize the life force in the blood.\nCameron isn’t seeking to answer these tough questions in a simple, concise manner. Rather, he utilizes story telling from modern experiences in view of God’s Word to prompt the audience to consider God’s response to evil since the creation of the world. It worked for us; we’re still talking about it four weeks later. The soundtrack is stirring, too. I was introduced to Warren Barfield’s, “The Time is Now” and my daughter has added several",
      "Father Gabriele Amorth said people who are possessed by Satan vomit shards of glass and pieces of iron.\nHe added that the assault on Pope Benedict XVI on Christmas Eve by a mentally unstable woman and the sex abuse scandals which have engulfed the Church in the US, Ireland, Germany and other countries, were proof that the Anti-Christ was waging a war against the Holy See.\n\"The Devil resides in the Vatican and you can see the consequences,\" said Father Amorth, 85, who has been the Holy See's chief exorcist for 25 years.\n\"He can remain hidden, or speak in different languages, or even appear to be sympathetic. At times he makes fun of me. But I'm a man who is happy in his work.\"\nWhile there was \"resistance and mistrust\" towards the concept of exorcism among some Catholics, Pope Benedict XVI has no such doubts, Father Amorth said. \"His Holiness believes wholeheartedly in the practice of exorcism. He has encouraged and praised our work,\" he added.\nThe evil influence of Satan was evident in the highest ranks of the Catholic hierarchy, with \"cardinals who do not believe in Jesus and bishops who are linked to the demon,\" Father Amorth said.\nIn a rare insight into the world of exorcism, the Italian priest told La Repubblica newspaper that the 1973 film The Exorcist gave a \"substantially exact\" impression of what it was like to be possessed by the Devil.\n~ more... ~\nMonday, March 15, 2010\nFather Gabriele Amorth said people who are possessed by Satan vomit shards of glass and pieces of iron.\nBy Bruce Kauffmann, Appeal-Democrat\nThis week in 1968, with America's involvement in the Vietnam War increasing every month, several platoons of American soldiers from Charlie Company were ordered to attack the tiny hamlet of My Lai in South Vietnam's Quang Ngai Province. The GIs were charged with destroying any Vietcong (North Vietnam's guerrilla army) they could find, and angered by both the casualties they had suffered at the hands of the Vietcong and their inability to catch this elusive quarry, when these GIs charged this hamlet they were in a \"take no prisoners\" mood. The result was a village destroyed and some 350 people dead.\nTragically, none of the dead was an armed Vietcon",

By the time she was born, the family business had been operating from their home for three years. Petra and her siblings grew up rolling crusts, peeling apples and baking pies with their parents from early on. In addition to bakery experience, Petra trained with family friend, Is Harris, making a variety of Thai cuisine from scratch, punctuating her culinary appreciation for both sweet and savory flavors and techniques. Subsequent training in oenology and cuisine both in Florence, Italy and Washington, DC led to her current position as wine buyer and recipe research and development at Mom's Apple Pie in Occoquan, Virginia.\nPetra Cox: Hi, I am Petra Cox from Mom s Apple Pie Company in Occoquan, Virginia and today I am showing you, how to process pumpkin or squash from scratch, so that you can make pumpkin pies, pumpkin breads and other pumpkin desserts.\nSo here I have this is an amber-cup pumpkin. It is actually a squash biologically but this makes a really excellent pumpkin pie and believe it or not so does a butternut squash. Anytime you might use a pumpkin in a dessert you could also use butternut squash and it gives it a really nice bright orange color and a nice sweet flavor as well. It s almost more pumpkiny than pumpkin. So to process your squash or your pumpkin, you are going to need a nice sharp knife and some pretty deep baking pan and a little water and we are going to cook it in a 400 degree oven.\nSo to process the butternut squash, first I am going to cut it right before the bowl starts at the bottom. This way you have the really meaty part at the top and then the part at the bottom has a hollow area with the seeds, you can put the cut side down, so it is really nice and steady and then just cut straight down the middle. You can see that there are some seeds and some sort of pithy material on the inside there and that you do not need to take out just yet. You can take that out after it is already been cooked and you just put the cut side down on the bottom of an ungreased pan. Then for the top you do not have to take the little stem off yet, only if you want to. You cut straight down the middle and since this is not been cooked yet, of course it",
      "Ventura County Family Portrait Photographer\nI love this family! So many giggles, hugs and snickers shared between us! From Oregon to California it’s been a pleasure photographing them. Here’s the latest and greatest in the Vorhees Family!\nQ: What inspired you to schedule a portrait session for your family?\nA: Portraits with Chelsea have become an annual tradition for our family. She has been shooting us every year (sometimes multiple times per year) since 2007.\nQ: What were you looking for in a portrait photographer?\nA: I look for someone with a great personality, casual style that will capture amazing, innovative shots while making things fun in the process.\nQ: What was your number one goal to achieve out of your portraits?\nA: I like to capture images of our family to see how we change one year to the next. This was the first year that my son could walk, so that made things extra fun!\nQ: What inspired you in styling your portrait session?\nA: My daughter had a favorite dress, she called it her “twirly dress” and I happened to find one for me that matched. We had never had matching outfits before, but it was fun to do it. She’s 4 now and probably won’t want to dress like her mom for many more years. We tried to coordinate Dad & Joe’s outfits with our dresses. I also had my daughter and I wear different jackets so things weren’t too “matchy-matchy”.\nQ: What do you plan on doing with your images?\nA: We use the images in our family calendar, holiday cards, photo books, the grandparents all get copies as well. But my favorite is the canvas that we order each year. We have them going up our stairway in chronological order and it’s my favorite part of our home’s decor.\nQ: How did friends & family react when you showed them the images for the first time?\nA: People just love Chelsea’s images. They can’t come into our home without seeing canvases of her work all over the walls and they always have such nice things to say about them! Chelsea has also shot my husband and my extended families (brothers, sisters, grandparents) – I highly recommend doing that every few years. It’s wonderful to have a big family portrait!\nQ: What surprised you most about your portrait session with Chelsea Elizabeth?\nA: Ha! How COLD it was!

      "Berkeley Daily Planet\n3023A Shattuck Ave.\nBerkeley, CA 94705\nThree days before her February community meeting (on going green), Oakland City council President Jane Brunner announced she would spend 3.3 million dollars of measure WW park funds on an artificial turf soccer field to be placed on top of the blacktop play area behind the old Washington School, now Sankofa Academy. It appears from her announcement that Jane has the power over park expenditures in her North Oakland district.\nBushrod Park, perhaps the largest park in North Oakland, already has three baseball fields, a soccer field, tennis courts, outdoor basketball courts and a recreation center. In fact, nearly ninety percent of of the park is given over to organized sports. There is no dog run, no natural area, bare picnic facilities, a poor children's playground and little flat space for unorganized play. Now Brunner wants to cover, not remove, a large section of blacktop that in the winter floods onto Shattuck Avenue.\nArtificial turf has become controversial across the United States for many reasons including; Friction between skin and artificial turf causes abrasions and/or burns to a much greater extent than natural grass, turf-toe is a medical condition often associated with playing on artificial turf pitches. A higher incidence of MRSA infections because pathogens are not readily broken down by natural processes and periodic disinfection is required. Artificial turf can become much hotter than natural grass when exposed to the sun, for cushioning it requires infill such as silicon sand and/or granulated rubber made from recycled car tires which may carry heavy metals. It has a short life span (10 year or less), can fail earlier and finally, artificial turf contributes to the loss of parks jobs and local funds are spent out of state for a manufactured petroleum product, and more petroleum is needed for shipping and installation.\nArtificial turf is not guaranteed against accident, machinery, spiked shoes, animals, misuse, fire, flood, chemical reactions, acts of God, static or dynamic loads exceeding the manufacturers specifications at time of installation, improper or faulty subsurface preparation, failure of the subsurface after the installation including settling of the surface, and the use of dry cleaning fluids or other improper cleaning methods. Artificial turf is subject to vandalism and even if the up-front costs are said to be cheaper, there is little research on its costs versus benefits.\nIt is great that Councilmember Brunner is seeking to improve Bushrod Park, but there has never been a",
      "\"The Pirates are extremely thrilled that Barney Dreyfuss was elected to the Hall of Fame today by the Veterans Committee,\" Pirates president Frank Coonelly said. \"It is gratifying to see that Mr. Dreyfuss' accomplishments have finally been recognized by the Hall of Fame.\"\nDreyfuss was one of three former baseball executives to be elected into the Hall of Fame by a newly formed Veterans Committee. There were a total of 10 executives considered. Votes were cast Sunday by a 12-member panel of current and former executives, Hall of Fame members and veteran media members.\nDreyfuss' name appeared on 10 of the 12 ballots (83.3 percent). Also receiving the necessary 75 percent of the vote from committee members were former Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley (10 votes) and Bowie Kuhn (nine votes), the second-longest tenured commissioner in baseball history.\nJoining those three executives as part of the 2008 Hall of Fame class are former managers Billy Southworth and Dick Williams, both of whom were elected by a separate Veterans Committee.\nFor Dreyfuss, national recognition is a fitting way to recognize a man whose contributions to the game have been vast and instrumental in its development.\nA German-born citizen, Dreyfuss set sail for America in 1885 at the age of 19, only to later become a key player during a critical time period for professional baseball. His legacy is still undoubtedly left on the game. But even more specifically, his mark is left on the Pittsburgh franchise.\nThat mark is in the walls of the famous Forbes Field. And his fingerprints were over the franchise during its formative years.\n\"Mr. Dreyfuss was a dynamic, innovative and extraordinarily competitive owner who built the Pirates into the dominant National League club at the turn of the century,\" Coonelly said. \"Mr. Dreyfuss began the culture of excellence in Pittsburgh that we are working hard to restore.\"\nDreyfuss is the first member of the Pirates family since Bill Mazeroski, in 2001, to be elected into the Hall. Among the other 12 are 11 Pirates players, as well as long-time manager Fred Clarke, who spent 15 years managing during Dreyfuss' tenure as Pittsburgh's owner.\nDreyfuss passed away in Pittsburgh in 1932 at the age of 66, serving as the team's",
      "Anyone into motorbikes has probably seen a Cafe Racer at some point, they are a fairly common type of modified bike for a retro look that doesn't resort to old Harleys and Indian cruisers. They are similar in concept to a bobber, strip a bike down and leave only the essentials to lighten the load for speed. Bobbers and Cafe Racers are not the same, from what I know of Bobbers and Cafe Racers, Cafe Racers have a forward seating position, like a sports bike, Bobbers are more of a cruiser, leaning back seating position. My intent with this build was not to create a true to the name Cafe Racer for various reasons, but make a highly stylized bike to look like one. I will cover a few reasons for this.\nUPDATE: Out Of Province Inspection and Fork Seals taking longer then expected. Oh well, we got a dump of snow, so its not like I could bring it home, even if I wanted to! :P\nStep 1: Reasoning For a Simpler, Toned-Down Builds\nOne big reason for going toned down was cost, obviously. I completed this build for about $1000 TOTAL. The bike I purchased for $500 in a running and driving condition with only 1500 original KM (900 miles) on it, which is fantastic, not so much for a 1984 bikes usually as it means it has sat but I was lucky, it was inside and I did replace some cover gaskets (valve cover, some crank cover gaskets) and the inside was immaculate. It had good tires, tank, seat, etc. as well. It was a steal of a deal. It may be fair to assume though that a budget of $1000 for a bike alone would be good. No point in buying junk.\nReasoning for not doing a true to the name Cafe Racer build was the low kilometers. If you bikes engine is in really good health (everything factory spec, good compression, etc) I suggest not putting on pod filters. Pods require re-jetting carbs, not a problem usually (although there are some bikes its impossible to run pods on, the carbs just won't jet properly), but they DO NOT filter as well. If you have a bike that is super duper, pods will gnaw away at the compression quickly. Pods do reduce the life expectancy of an engine, fact. With an engine with 1",

      "MALAGA, SPAIN • In the full-sized luxury car segment, Audi has always maintained a conservative approach with somewhat understated styling, which has allowed the A8 to fly under the radar, unburdened by the attention reserved for the more distinctive images of BMW’s 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz’s S-Class. In short, the A8 has always been the large luxury car of choice for individuals who did not want to draw undue attention to themselves or their wealth.\nWith the new 2011 A8, Audi has given its flagship executive sedan a more contemporary and aerodynamic look that also manages to respect the brand’s lineage. Up front, the signature corporate grille has been updated with eight horizontal chrome strips, and the headlights, which can be outfitted with optional full LED technology, actually “follow” the road as their direction adjusts according to input supplied by the car’s navigation system. At the rear, the new car looks very much like a larger A4, and the overall impression left is that of a lower and sleeker executive sedan, which is confirmed by its lower drag coefficient (now 0.26), even though the new A8 is both longer and wider than the previous model as well as its main German rivals.\nPower is still supplied by the now very familiar 4.2-litre V8, which delivers 372 horsepower and 328 pound-feet of torque. The engine doesn’t allow Audi to claim bragging rights as it trails its main competition in the horsepower race. However, the automaker does claim a 15% improvement in fuel consumption over the previous model, which is largely due to the V8 now being mated to a ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic gearbox, complete with steering wheel shift paddles and the brand’s signature quattro all-wheel drive. Available for the European market are a pair of turbocharged diesel engines — a 3.0L V6 and 4.2L V8 — the latter of which may become available in North America at a later date.\nAs was the case with the previous model, the engine is still positioned ahead of the front axle, which presents a less-than-ideal proposition in regards to weight distribution and the natural tendency for the car to understeer when pushed hard in cornering. However, for the new model, Audi has borrowed some technology from the S4 and S5 in the form of a torque-vectoring rear differential, which helps to “turn” the car into the",
      "The Constitutional Court will hear closing arguments for President Park Geun-hye’s trial next Friday, adding momentum to expectations that the disgraced leader’s fate will be decided in early March.\nAfter the 14th hearing wrapped up on Thursday, Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi declared that the judges plan to end the hearings next Friday. She requested Park’s lawyers and the National Assembly, which acts as the prosecution in the trial, to submit their written positions by Thursday and prepare to make closing arguments on Friday.\n“The power of the president, the head of the administration, has been suspended and the vacuum in the state affairs and the subsequent social chaos are continuing for more than two months,” Lee said.\n“We have worked hard for a fair and speedy trial,” Lee added, noting that the judges already questioned dozens of witnesses, reviewed investigation reports, verified various facts and decided to hear the closing arguments next week.\nThe National Assembly passed a motion to impeach Park on Dec. 9, 2016 for allowing her secret inner circle, including controversial friend Choi Soon-sil, to influence state affairs. It also said Park failed to protect the lives of the citizens during the Sewol ferry’s sinking on April 16, 2014 due to her nonfeasance in the crucial early hours of the rescue operation.\nPark’s presidential powers were suspended immediately and the court was given 180 days to decide whether to remove her permanently. Six of its nine judges have to confirm the legislature’s action. Since then, the Constitutional Court held three preparatory meetings and 14 hearings until Thursday. Of the nine judges, Chief Justice Park Han-chul retired last month, and the trial has been operated by eight judges since then. Acting Chief Justice Lee’s tenure will end on March 13 and speculations were high that the court will try to rule before another vacancy is created in order to protect the integrity of the ruling.\nThrough the 14 hearings, the court heard from 27 witnesses, including Choi and former Blue House aides. Two more hearings will take place until Wednesday and closing arguments will be delivered on Friday, although Park’s lawyers protested the court’s decision to hear closing arguments then.\n“The court scheduled it in a hurry,” said Lee Joong-hwan, one of the lawyers. “This is a very special case, and it is dangerous to wrap up the trial without sufficient hearings.”\nIt remains to be seen if Park will attend the closing session to argue for herself. “I will have to",

I hope he's doing something restful in his own Bag End today, perhaps smoking a pipe or reading a good book, or that he's celebrating in as lively a manner as a Hobbit, amongst good friends and family.\nIt's a bit eerie watching Balin relating the story of the battle outside Moria and the death of Thror when I know the Fellowship will find Balin's own tomb in the Mines some 60 odd years later.\nYeah -- I think a *lot* of people watching the film didn't make the association between Balin and his LOTF tomb, since many people haven't read the books and weren't paying attention to the \"Balin\" reference in FOTR.\nThen cue the shocked gasp if, at the end of TABA, Balin says he wants to go reconquer Moria in the name of his King, making the viewers realise just how failed an enterprise it is. Talk about a downer ending...\nTBH, Barriss, I had forgotten about the Hobbit-LOTR connection for Balin, and I read both books long before I ever saw the LOTR films. I only remembered it now because I just spent the last week watching all four films, starting with FOTR and ending with AUJ. Even then, it didn't click until after I watched the first half of AUJ yesterday.\n@Laurethiel, could be a possibility, but I'm not really sure. In the books Balin didn't ask leave to go to Moria until about 45-",

It will also be livestreamed at 6:00 p.m. on September 18 here.\nIn This Changes Everything, her first new book in seven years, Naomi Klein, author of the global #1 bestsellers The Shock Doctrine and No Logo, tackles the most profound threat humanity has ever faced: the war our economic model is waging against life on earth.\nClimate change, Klein argues, is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms, and droughts. Confronting it is no longer about changing the light bulbs. It’s about changing the world. We have been told that humanity is too greedy and selfish to rise to this challenge. In fact, all around the world, the fight for the next economy and against reckless extraction is already succeeding in ways both surprising and inspiring.\nKlein will speak about the book followed by a discussion with special guests about the call to engage fundamentally with the issue of climate change.

      "As it turned out, much of my suffering the past three months was due to yeast overgrowth, a fact that I didn't figure out until about a month ago. I wanted to share my recent experiences with you in the hopes that perhaps it might help some of you.\nYeast (aka candida) are a type of fungus that normally live in small amounts in your mouth and digestive tract. Problems occur when the yeast increases and/or good bacteria in your gut that normally keeps it in check decreases. One common cause of this yeast overgrowth is taking antibiotics - they kill off all the bacteria in your system, including the good stuff that lives in your digestive tract, allowing the yeast to take over. This is what happened to me this time. Back in September, I took 5 days' of Zithromax for bronchitis. Under normal circumstances, such a small amount of antibiotics wouldn't bother me (especially since I take probiotics every day - see below), but ever since I was treated for Lyme disease (over 3 years of antibiotics every day), I've had occasional flare-ups of yeast overgrowth.\nFor those of us who have ME/CFS, we don't even need antibiotics to cause yeast overgrowth. Since immune system and GI dysfunctions are an integral part of our illness, yeast overgrowth is a very common occurrence, though one that is often missed or not diagnosed.\nHow did I know I had a problem with yeast overgrowth? Well, it took me many weeks to figure it out, even though I've experienced it before. My symptoms included fatigue that was much worse than usual and severe flu-like aches all over my body; in fact, the aches these past few months were some of the worst I have experienced in my 12 years with ME/CFS. Increased brain fog is also common with yeast overgrowth. At one point, I looked back at my records and saw that of the past 60 days, I'd only been well enough to leave the house 14 days. That's far worse than is normal for me. For a long time, I assumed that the virus that triggered my crash initially (and started my bronchitis) was the reason for the prolonged crash.\nI finally figured out that yeast was responsible when I noticed that my tongue hurt, especially when I ate certain foods (anything bitter, sour, or sugary). The light bulb finally went off at that point, and I ran to the bathroom mirror. Sure enough, I had active thrush",
      "Assorted historical stuff:\nEditorial: \"Crude petroleum selling in the fields at less than 10 cents a barrel in Texas and averaging 18 cents in Kansas means that a long threatened disaster has now overtaken the oil producers of the US.\" Producers may now try drastic action to rescue themselves; Federal govt. \"should think twice before interfering\" even though \"some things may be done which will fall outside a strict construction of the antitrust statutes.\" With the oil market in its current state, \"restraint of trade can ... have little more than academic interest to the consumer.\" It may be argued that producers have themselves to blame, and this may be true in some areas such as East Texas, but producers who \"conscientiously\" curtail production in one area can be \"set at naught\" by \"the folly of wild overproduction\" elsewhere. Texas will now try once more to combat this folly by \"drastic legislation\"; \"producers throughout the midcontinent field can help ... by uniting in restrictive measures, even to closing down where that is practicable.\" The cause is not lost; \"Oil has not lost its intrinsic value to the world. Consumers are still willing to pay a substantial price for it.\" 4,500 oil wells in Southwest Texas face shutdown due to low crude prices; this will ruin many of the wells due to water intrusion.\nPres. Hoover denounced as unpatriotic the short-selling of wheat by “a limited number of speculators,” but made it clear he wasn't referring to ordinary hedging transactions or the legitimate grain trade; regarding the speculators, said “the confidence imposed upon me by law ... does not permit me to expose their names.” Extraordinary bear market in wheat has now lasted two years in spite of govt. efforts to maintain prices. July wheat is now below 53 cents/bushel, down over 93 cents from peak of July 1929. In recent sessions, prices have dropped steadily in spite of some bullish news including very poor Canadian crop and report of substantially smaller world supply in 1931-32. Farmers have been hard hit; an Illinois analysis put the cost of production for wheat at 69 1/4 cents/bushel, vs. a price at the local grain elevator of 38 1/4 cents. Situation seen \"forcing curtailment ... to a greater degree than any behests of a governmental agency.\"\nUnited Mine Workers officials were invited to",
      "View: Let’s restart our engines and accelerate Miami’s tech-hub potential\nPosted on August 7, 2012 by nina\nPublished by The Miami Herald\nFew places on Earth invoke the kind of economic envy that Northern California’s Silicon Valley does. So much so, that hopes of being the “next Silicon Valley” have spawned scores of wannabes worldwide such as Silicon Oasis (Dubai), Silicon Cape (Cape Town) and Silicon Sloboda (Moscow). In the U.S., “Silicon Beach” is coveted by five cities, among them Miami.\nObviously, all these places share the same ambition: to attain the lucrative concentration of fresh talent, disruptive ideas and venture capital that has driven Silicon Valley’s technological innovation and financial success over the past 50 years. The problem is that there’s only one, and will always will be only one, Silicon Valley.\nShould places like South Florida, with the means to foster technological innovation locally, abandon their ambitions? In a word, no. Some, like Israel’s Silicon Wadi, have gone beyond pretension: The Economist ranked it second in the world to Silicon Valley in the concentration of home-grown, high-tech companies, with U.S.-based global firms such as IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Cisco and others having research facilities there.\nDid Silicon Wadi happen overnight? No, it took about 40 years, with roots established even earlier than that. Did the Israeli government help? Yes, with low-interest loans and substantial grants, many notably from Israel’s military. Was academia involved? Indeed, Israel’s Technion – Israel Institute of Technology – and its Weizmann Institute of Science are ranked among the world’s top 20 academic institutions in computer science. Venture capital? Yes, that helped accelerate the region’s success, too.\nIn the late ‘90s, Latin American entrepreneurs flocked to Miami, considered the Americas’ crossroads. The Lincoln Road promenade teemed with Latin notables, such as StarMedia Network, Yupi.com, Patagon.com, DeRemate, Viajo.com, eritmo.com and El Sitio, while others, like Zona Financiera and Telefonica de Espana’s Terra Networks were nearby. Although South Florida wasn’t a tech hotbed then any more than now, IBM’s Boca Raton campus was where the PC was born and still employed more than 10,000 people. Fort Lauderdale’s Citrix",
      "In the various figures, projects or coordination processes relating European level to the Industrial and intellectual property undoubtedly the European Patent Effect Unit (better known as unitary patent) and the Unified Patent Court is expected to be much affected, as indicates our expert Carmen Sánchez-Puelles:\nBREXIT EFFECTS FOR THE EUROPEAN PATENT WITH UNITARY EFFECT AND UNIFIED PATENT COURT\nOnce you know the result of the referendum in the UK, the first question we ask ourselves is the effect it could have its EXIT from U.E in the new patent system.\nSo far, we assumed the entry into force of unitary patent package in the imminent future, ie in 2017, coinciding practically with the entry into force of the new Patent Law in Spain. However, the new situation in which is situated the UK creates uncertainty about the future of the system.\nCurrently ten Member States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Sweden and Bulgaria have ratified the agreement.\nFor the new patent system to become operational, it would need only Britain and Germany, and an additional Member State to ratify the Agreement on the Unified Court.\nHowever, despite the outcome of that referendum, it could still become reality the entry into force of this system of European patent with unitary effect, since now a two-year period is opened to negotiate the final exit of the U.E.\nTherefore, we consider two possible scenarios:\na) If the United Kingdom ratify the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court, the unitary patent system could be implemented. However, because a non-EU member state can not be part of the unitary patent system, and the agreement of TUP does not include provisions relating to the exit of a Member State, this situation could lead to a possible relocation of the section of the central division of London, as what established by the Agreement is that the central division of the Court of First Instance will be based in Paris, with sections in London and Munich.\nb) If the UK does not ratify the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court and the Agreement is not modified, the system of unitary patent could not enter into force until the UK leave the EU as Article 89.1 of the Agreement establishes that this Agreement will enter into force only if such tools are those of the three Member States which have had effects the highest number of European patents the year prior to the signing of the Agreement, namely, Germany, France and the UK. Therefore, when the UK leave the U.E,",
      "AMD's Hector Ruiz: Floundery Company's Slyest Rat Of All\nRegular readers of my Hubs are well aware that I have squarely placed the blame of AMD's demolition on the shoulders of former CEO Hector Ruiz. It was his ill-advised strategy to mortgage the farm in order to buy out Canadian graphics card manufacturer ATI while turning a blind eye to the fact that the Barcelona (Phenom) CPU chip was headed 90 miles an hour down a dead end street that caused AMD's stock to plummet from over $40 to $3. With the recent development that Abu Dhabi based Mubadala was going to inject between six and eight billion dollars into the company in order to split it up into:\nThe very innovatively named (!) Foundry Company which will only manufacture chips\nAMD which will continue to (try to) market CPUs and graphics cards.\nIt seems that our good Doctor Ruiz has managed to be the lead rat jumping off the sinking AMD ship by positioning himself at the head of the board of Foundry while leaving the mess that is AMD (which should have been renamed Floundery Company) in the capable hands of Dirk (Diggler) Meyer.\nMr. Meyer now faces the unenviable prospect of trying hard to launch Shanghai, a 45 nm CPU which is barely competitive with monster competitor Intel's last generation Penryn, at about the same time as Big Blue is about to launch Nehalem / Core i7 which will do to Shanghai what Michael Phelps would do to me in a 200 meter butterfly.\nMeyer's AMD is now stuck one full generation behind Intel with absolutely no hope in Hades of being able to catch up, especially by next year when the Blue Team launches Core i7's next iteration, the 32nm Westmere which is not so much Michael Phelps as it is Superman. With its ATI division suffering from a similar technological handicap and able to compete with main competitor Nvidia only by savage pricecutting (and yes, also due to Nvidia's own internal screwups), AMD's days are numbered. Hector Ratuiz was well aware that the Greenies' future prospects were as bright as its major lifeline provider, the now defunct Lehman Brothers...\nSo... he jumped!\nRiding billions of oil money, ol' Doc Hector plunked himself at the head of the Foundry Company's boardroom table figuring that even though AMD had the life expectancy of a fruit fly, there would always be a market demand for silicon: Even after AMD",

However, there is also another, less famous part, but it also has big potential. Two specific fellas, the Pichu Brothers, live in that district, who are now climbing up on some tires. On the top, they start playing on a teeter and make noise, a call for adventure. This call is heard throughout the district and a Smoochum, a Teddiursa, a Wooper and a Magby hear their call and decide to go visit the brothers, Pichu Little and Pichu Big. As everyone gathers, Teddiursa jumps onto the teeter, catapulting Wooper onto a slide. Wooper, at the end, is amused by this slide, so Smoochum, Teddiursa, Magby and Pichu Big decide to slide down. Pichu Little goes on the first spot, ignoring the others, but Pichu Big pulls him away.\nPichu Little falls down on the wooden platform and gets angry and starts yelling at his brother.

      "Delight Yourself In the Lord\n“Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.”\nThere are several ways you can look at this scripture. The first is that if you delight yourself in the Lord, God will answer your prayers and give you what you’ve been desiring. I believe that, but also look at something else it is saying to us. If you delight yourself in the Lord, he will give you the desires of your heart. He will put those desires in you.\nIf you’re focused on Him first and have put Him first in your life, then the desires in your heart also come from Him. If it your heart’s desire to go to college to become a doctor, then that desire has been placed there by God. If your heart’s desire is to own real estate, then you know where you should be focusing your attention. If your heart’s desire is to start a business, then He is the one who put that desire in you.\nStarting a business can be a risky venture, so a lot of people go through life living way below their purpose because of fear. You’ll have to step out of your comfort zone. You’ll have to spend time learning all the aspects of business. You’ll have to put money at risk to study, research, and find people who can work with you. It is not always easy. There are millions of Christians who go through their whole life working a mediocre job knowing there is something greater for them. They get up and go to work day after day…while their heart cries out for something more. You can have so much more. You can complete your calling. If you haven’t already started, then use this book as your kick in the seat of your pants to get you moving.\nMake a decision today you won’t just do what is most comfortable. You’re going to step up to your next level in life. It is time for God’s champions to come forth. It is time for people who love God to start taking action in the business world. For too long the church has looked at pastors and evangelists as being the only ones with a special calling from God. This is wrong!\nPeople who are “in the ministry” are simply those who are called to teach others in the church. Most real ministry takes place outside of the four church walls. You are called of God as one of his ministers. A Christian business person is a calling. It is a ministry. You may be the only Jesus people",
      "Legendary Wings (アレスの翼Aresu no Tsubasa, \"The Wings of Ares\") is a fantasy-themed shoot-'em-up game released by Capcom as a coin-operated video in 1986. The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer. A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released exclusively in North America in 1988. The original coin-op version is included in Capcom Classics Collection: Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and in Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for PlayStation Portable.\nLegendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \"Dark\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival.\nThe coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at anytime or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score.\nThe player can improve their gun by destroying certain enemies or weapon capsules and picking up the \"P\" item stored inside. The player can power-up their character up to five levels: the initial power-up will increase the player's speed; the second will change their gun to a twin shooter, as well as further increase their speed;",
      "Niger is one of the world’s poorest countries (44.5% of poverty incidence in 2014). The country faces a number of challenges in meeting the national (PROSEHA, the National Program for sustainable development) and global targets to increase access to sanitation and potable water, particularly in rural areas where the access to water is 44.2% and 7% for sanitation (2015 Ministry of Water and Sanitation data).\nOvercoming these challenges while satisfying increasing demands for better or expanded service, the government began investigating options that bring in the know-how of the private sector. This has led to a growing domestic private sector provision of services in Niger.\nOver the past five years, the World Bank supported efforts to work with sector stakeholders to foster the participation of domestic private entities in the management of rural water supply systems (RWSSs). This support was done through the development of a regulatory and legal framework and capacity building activities. The coordination among stakeholders has been facilitated through the convening of regular bi-monthly sector dialogues and an annual sector review meeting.\nI recently conducted a case study on domestic private sector participation in the delivery of water and sanitation services in Niger. In 1998, the government of Niger began involving the private sector in service delivery in water and sanitation, when it carried out a vast reform agenda in public service delivery, alongside the telecom, transport, and energy sectors. In 2001, urban water supply reforms resulted in the creation of two key entities: a public asset-holding company, Société de Patrimoine des Eaux du Niger (SPEN), which is responsible for investment and debt service repayment of urban water infrastructure; and a private company, Société d’Exploitation des Eaux du Niger (SEEN), responsible for the operation of infrastructure and the marketing of water services. This reform has led to an improved urban water performance - in 2001 the access was 64.6% against 91.2% in 2015; the network efficiency was 78% in 2001 against 84% in 2015; and the water bill recovery rate increased from 78% 2001 to 90% in 2015.\nEven though private sector participation in water supply has been a long-standing policy in the country, several challenges persist, including:\n- Difficulty in mobilizing the private sector in rural and",

Unlike normal\njuggling, in which objects are thrown, spun, or balanced, in\ncontact juggling, as its name implies, objects remain in\ncontact with the body. The standard object used is a\ntransparent ball, which is usually plastic,but has the look of\na magical crystal ball. This ball is rolled in patterns over\nthe hands and arms (and sometimes chest, feet, and head). There\nare endless variations, and there is no throwing or catching,\nso the effect is extremely graceful. It tends to have\ndifferent effects on different watchers - some people are\nindifferent, while others simply cannot tear their eyes\naway. The clear balls pick up light from the surroundings, so\nif there are brightly colored lights nearby, the balls will\ntwinkle and flash as they move.\nThe introduction to James Ernest's book\n\"The illusion created is one of a free-floating,\nweightless ball, subject to unusual laws of motion. A good\ncontact juggler can make his own movements seem almost\nunrelated to the movements of the ball; the attention of the\naudience is always fixed on the ball. Contact juggling is,\nabove all, graceful and absorbing.\"\nWhile manipulating these clear balls is the most common form\nof contact juggling, it is not the only one. Any manipulation\nthat keeps an object in contact with the body is contact\njuggling. This includes things like Harlem\nGlobetrotter style basketball rolls and the habitual\npen-spinning of bored students.\nCJ with clear balls has been around for at least ten years,\nbut my observations suggest that it only begun moving from\nincredibly obscure to moderately obscure in the late 90's. At\nmy college, for example, no\none else had heard of CJ when I got there in 1994, but by 1997\nseveral arriving students were practitioners of the art.\nWhere might I have seen Contact Juggling?\n- The most common place to have seen CJ is in Labyrinth\n[IMDB], a 1986\nJim",

Hop on over to Miranda‘s to learn how to draft and construct leggings, another wardrobe staple!\nLet’s start with the a-line maxi, and you’ll need to take a few quick measurements. Before you do, let’s talk a bit about ease. Ease is the space between the garment and your body; without added ease, this pattern will be fitted at the waist and hips because the measurements of the skirt will equal your body measurements. The skirt I made has no ease added, but if you want a little more room, then you’ll need to add some ease—I suggest 1-2 inches. For this skirt you would only add it to the waist and the hip measurements, and I strongly suggest just the hip IF you decide to add ease. Always add it in before you divide (i.e. hip measurement plus 2” ease divided by 4).\n- Waist to desired length:distance between the waist and desired length.\n- Waist to hip: distance between the waist and hip.\n- Quarter waist: true waist plus optional ease, divided by 4.\n- Quarter hip: fullest part of your bum plus optional ease, divided by 4.\n- Quarter hip measurement plus 8-10″, depending on how flared you want you skirt. TIP: Slight fullness would be hip measurement X 1.5, medium fullness would be hip measurement X 2, and considerable fullness would be hip measurement X 3. Considering that guide, my quarter hip measurement plus 8 equals medium fullness. Another way to determine this is to lay out a tape measure and then to step into the center of it in order to visualize what the",
      "Professor William Sjostrom disagrees with my post yesterday about Leon Kass. And in the spirit of constructive criticism, he offers some suggestions to improve my blogging. The suggestions are generally sound, but I see no need to change either the substance or the form of my post.\nSuggestion: “In fairness, you ought to link to the original Kass article.”\nFine. Professor Sjostrom helpfully provides this link.\nSuggestion: “Never assess a serious scholar on the basis on the basis of a quote of part of a sentence in the press. . . . [This] particularly applies if it [is] the New York Times.\"\nGenerally quite sound. But in this case, the Times quoted Professor Kass 100% accurately. Even more importantly, the quote—however brief—accurately summarizes the main point of Professor Kass’s piece. He argues that the prospect of death greatly improves human life, so we should not try to substantially lengthen our life span.\nA final suggestion: “Before criticizing, read the whole article. . . . know what the scholar thinks, not just what his critics think he thinks.”\nAgain, generally excellent advice, but again irrelevant here for the reason just cited: the quote does not misrepresent Professor Kass’s thinking one iota.\nAnd what about Professor Kass’s thinking? Perhaps a few words are in order to explain why I reacted strongly.\nProfessor Kass asks “If life is good and more is better, should we not regard death as a disease and try to cure it?” He answers no. He concludes:\nPerhaps mortality is not simply an evil, perhaps it is even a blessing—not only for the welfare of the community, but even for us as individuals. How could this be? I wish to make the case for the virtues of mortality. Against my own strong love of life, and against my even stronger wish that no more of my loved ones should die, I aspire to speak truth to my desires by showing that the finitude of human life is a blessing for every human individual, whether he knows it or not.\nI think this conclusion is wrong—profoundly wrong—for four reasons.\n1. Professor Kass notes that there is a large and widely supported program of research aimed at lengthening the human lifespan. If he aspires to more than just airy philosophizing, he will eventually have to propose supressing or regulating this research. There is thus implicit in his argument a tremendous cost: a decrease in medical research and a loss of free scientific inquiry",

Earlier in the season, several Huskies missed a game to take the ACT. ``That`s what you get when you have smart kids,`` Kaiser said. . . . Mundelein senior Tim Deal hit for the cycle against Wauconda on May 2, then two days later, collected six hits, including two home runs and 10 RBIs during a double-header against Zion-Benton. . . .

      "Snedeker, Johnson, McDowell Already Lining up for 2014 AT&T in Pebble Beach\nJan. 7, 2014\nThe upcoming AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am has already got some star power.\nThe Monterey Peninsula Foundation, which runs the event, recently announced that both 2013 winner Brandt Snedeker and 2009-2010 champ Dustin Johnson have confirmed to play. Also confirming was Graeme McDowell, who won the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nThe tournament will be held Feb. 3-9 at the Shore Course at Monterey Peninsula Country Club, Spyglass Hill and Pebble Beach.\nOne of the keys to Snedeker’s win last year was his play on Pebble’s notoriously tough Cliffs of Doom stretch (Nos. 8-10). While others wilted there, Snedeker played the stretch at 1-under over his two rounds at Pebble.\n“I tried to be aggressive on those holes,” said Snedeker, who carded only five bogeys the entire tournament. “The more aggressive you get, the more chances you turn that from a par hole into a birdie hole.”\nAnother key was simply that Snedeker was the hottest player on the planet at the time. Snedeker was on such a roll coming into the tournament that he shook off what had previously been a mediocre history at the AT&T Pro-Am. Prior to the victory his best finish was a tie for 21st in 2010. In both 2009 and 2011 he missed the cut, while in 2007 and 2008, his only other two appearances, he finished T-58 and T-36, respectively.\nJohnson, who captured the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions in China in November, won the rain-shortened 2009 AT&T by four over Mike Weir. A year later he became only the fifth back-to-back AT&T winner (joining Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Mark O’Meara) after defeating J.B. Holmes and David Duval by a stroke.\nOne thing that’ll be different for Johnson this time around will be his caddie. During his 2009 and 2010 wins, Johnson had former Pebble Beach caddie Bobby",
      "The Right Honourable Ramon John Hnatyshyn\nRideau Hall has always been one of Ottawa's most interesting landmarks. During the Right Honourable Ramon John Hnatyshyn's term of office, the official residence began to be known as a tourist destination, with many Canadians enjoying tours of the public rooms and grounds. In 1991, Mr. Hnatyshyn created the Governor General's Summer Concert Series, which became a popular annual music festival. In the winter of 1992, he re-opened the historic skating rink, which had been closed since the 1989/90 season. The rink is used by members of the public on weekends, and by educational institutions and associations throughout the week.\nMr. Hnatyshyn and his wife Gerda were determined to develop Rideau Hall into a showcase for Canadian excellence. In 1994, Mrs. Hnatyshyn co-authored a book, \"Rideau Hall - Canada's Living Heritage\", with the understanding that the proceeds would be used to expand the national collection of art and furnishings at the official residence. Mrs. Hnatyshyn also collaborated with the Canadian Heritage Garden Foundation, an independent charitable foundation, to construct a Heritage Garden as a particular point of interest on the Rideau Hall grounds.\nAs Canada's de facto Head of State, Mr. Hnatyshyn and his wife received leaders and dignitaries from around the world. Their guests included President Lech Walesa of Poland, Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin of Israel, President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation, Their Majesties the King and Queen of Jordan, and President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia. Mr. and Mrs. Hnatyshyn also welcomed many members of the Royal Family, including Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1991. The Hnatyshyn's also travelled abroad, representing Canada at the 50th anniversary celebrations of D-Day in France in 1994, and going on several State visits, including one to Ukraine, which was particularly special because Mr. Hnatyshyn is of Ukranian descent.\nThe Hnatyshyn's encouragement of the arts in Canada was one of the important accomplishments of their term. They established the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards in 1992, along with the Ramon John Hnat",
      "Private donors will cover city's costs for Lakers parade [Updated]\nOfficials announced this morning that private donors will pay the city's entire share for the Lakers championship victory parade, capping days of debate that roiled City Hall.\nLos Angeles City Council President Eric Garcetti said this morning that it appeared enough private donations have been raised to pay for Wednesday’s parade to celebrate the Lakers’ NBA championship.\n[Updated at 11:40 a.m.: Several City Council members had voiced opposition to using any tax dollars to pay for the parade because of the city’s financial crisis, which is expected to lead to widespread city layoffs and worker furloughs starting in July.\nOver the weekend, city officials urged the owners of the Lakers and Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns Staples Center, to pick up the tab for the celebration. The two already pledged to pay more than $1 million in parade production costs.\nThe parade is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Staples Center and travel to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\nSources told The Times two media executives and several other people stepped forward to help the city pay for its share of the parade celebrating the Lakers’ 15th championship.\nApproximately $450,000 has been donated by Casey and Laura Wasserman, Jerry and Margie Perenchio and others, and other major contributions were pledged Monday. Casey Wasserman is the grandson of former Universal Pictures Chairman Lew Wasserman. Jerry Perenchio is the former chairman of Univision Communications.\nMayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s office estimated the city’s costs could approach $900,000, but council members said those expenses could be much less because the parade route is shorter than in past years.\n“I think they are very close. My last report was about an hour ago,’’ said Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district includes the Staples Center.\nAEG President Tim Leiweke has taken the most active role in raising private donations to ensure that no city tax dollars are needed to fund the parade, city officials said.\n“I have to give a lot recognition to Tim’s efforts,\" Perry said. “The Lakers and AEG have always been very responsive to community needs. ... I’m not at all surprised that they have stepped up to be good civic partners.\"]\nMayor Antonio Villaraigosa initially promised that the city would foot half of the parade's $2-million cost, which includes renting the Coliseum. He then said AEG would pay half the costs.\nHowever, that",
      "This blog started out to be another chapter of Ancestor Birthday Celebrations, in remembrance of my great grandmother Lorena Estelle Eley Norsworthy Dews Harlow Lenahan Collins. As I was contemplating what I might write, my mind wandered off to points here and there, but, mostly to the Civil War Monument here in the Franklin Cemetery, Lenawee County. At some point, I realized that Lorena was born on the very day this monument was originally dedicated, July 4, 1866. Mind you, Lorena was born in Zuni, Isle of Wight County, Virginia, about 700 miles from Franklin.\nEver since we moved to Lenawee, in 1995, I have had an extremely strong but unexplained attachment to the Civil War Monument in the Franklin Cemetery. To my knowledge, I am not related to anyone in Lenawee County, now or in the past. I am a southern born gal who was raised and lived in the north for all but a few of her years here on this good earth. I have no Union soldiers in my heritage, Man does, I do not.\nThis monument is said to be the 1st or 2nd monument in Michigan, and maybe in the United States, dedicated after the conflict ended, paid for by popular subscription, dedicated July 4, 1866. That date always startles me, as it is 1 year, 2 months and 15 days after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox on April 19, 1865, and 1 year 1 month and 30 days after the last meeting of the Confederate Cabinet (Washington, Georgia, May 5, 1865). That does not seem like a lot of time to bring the boys home, start a project to design, finance, produce and raise a monument. I believe the monument is over 30 foot tall, it is made of sandstone, original cost was $1,500.00.\nImagine my surprise when one day in 2005 I made a visit to the cemetery and found the monument MIA. All I could find was the base. I hoped that it was being repaired, but had heard nothing about it, no one I asked seemed to know much about it. (Must not have asked the right people! LOL)\nBy early summer 2006, the monument was BACK!",

One example of where such money has been\nredirected was the $3-million salary-cap exemption teams received to keep\nveterans this past season. This season, teams will have three $1.5-million\nAccording to Francis, performance-based pay is a part of the new CBA and will\nbe paid out in the future, though the league and the union are \"still\nnegotiating the language.\"\nFollowing the 2009 season, the league handed out over $109 million in\nperformance-based pay.

      "After all the dreadful series that have premiered in the last month, it's downright therapeutic to watch Latin Music USA (Monday, 9 p.m., PBS). Here, finally, is a well-made production, full of humor and drama. I was beginning to think the broadcast networks had forgotten how to entertain us.\nThe ambitious documentary shows how Latin music crossed into our borders; how it mutated into Afro-Cuban jazz, mambo, cha-cha-cha, salsa and Chicano rock; and how it affected the American experience of the past eight decades. Given the subject matter, a dry history lesson simply would not do. Instead, the documentary reflects the elegance and excitement of Latin music in video clips, photographs and interviews. The filmmaking cha-cha-chas in perfect time with its soundtrack.\nEpisode one begins in the 1930s, when Cuban musicians discovered the vibrant Harlem jazz scene. Cuban players like Machito and Mario Bauza were turned on by jazz, and jazz players like Dizzy Gillespie were turned on by Latin sounds. The resulting hybrid delighted the large Puerto Rican population in Spanish Harlem and eventually crept south to midtown Manhattan, where it was discovered by everybody else. Interviewees describe the thrilling 1950s Latin music scene at the Palladium Ballroom, in which segregated cultures flouted convention by dancing together. \"It was the beginning of true integration in New York City,\" says one commentator.\nIt's impossible to sit still while watching Latin Music USA, and that makes life difficult for a TV reviewer.

      "Jonathan Outsourcing War Against Boko Haram While Millions of Nigerian Youth Are Unemployed\nFeb 5, 2015 – Jonathan Outsourcing War against Boko Haram While Millions of Nigerian Youth Are Unemployed\nThe Nigerian government has reportedly outsourced the war against Boko Haram. The Chadians were first hired in million dollar deals and next mercenaries were chartered from South Africa to the dismay and frank anger of the South African authorities. [The Nation of 31st January]\nIt can be safely concluded at this point that the Goodluck Jonathan-led government despises Nigerian youth.\nWhile several millions of youth are unemployed with some of the largest numbers unemployed in the affected northeast, the Jonathan government could not see it useful to take advantage of our own who better know the terrain and enemy and have already been engaged and dying as “Civilian-JTF” fighting Boko Haram and defending our communities, but rather sees it best to invest billions of Naira to charter foreign soldiers and mercenaries in hope of squashing Boko Haram before the election.\nThis is one more of the greatest shames to the Nigerian people. Apart from once again triggering a row with South Africa, who were obviously pissed that Nigeria was chartering mercenaries, Nigeria has embarrassed itself globally as a nation that relies on everything from technology to human resource by import.\nNigeria’s Chief of defense, Air Chief Alex Badeh lied to the nation in September of last year that they will indeed assimilate and convert the Civilian-JTF patriots into a “professional fighting force” to combat Boko Haram [Thisday, 20th Sept. 2014]. But this was obviously a gimmick as the boys allowed only dane guns and machetes were continuously sacrificed and sent in the front line of the “scared military” to fight the wars with Boko Haram, yet denied training and arms as promised. And when time came for Nigeria to invest in its defense, mercenaries from South Africa and Chad were hired with billions of naira and our boys and our army were left cold.\nApart from not understanding the complexity of crime and terror and how these are increased by social disadvantages, and policies such as these, the Jonathan government is simply wicked, tactless and unpatriotic.\nSo many of us begged for the right to bear arms to go fight Boko Haram and die while at it if such was our destiny [ENDS 26th April, 2014]. So many of us have been engaged in the war already; fighting and",
      "Close this window\nIt’s the goal of every nonprofit that creates a video –\ncreating a video that has impact. Examining what makes video have an impact was\nthe topic of TechSoup’s recent Digital Storytelling\nChallenge tweet chat. The deadline for submissions is February 29 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, so there's still time to take these tips and apply them to your digital story!\nJoining the chat were experts behind some memorable\nnonprofit videos Christina Samala, Director\nof Online Strategy & Media for The\nStory of Stuff Project; Kirthi\nNath, Media Producer and Filmmaker at Cinemagical\nMedia; and Mike Bonifer, co-founder\nand CEO of GameChangers, LLC.\nthe hour-long chat on Twitter, nonprofit video experts and audience shared thoughts on\nwhat makes powerful videos, technical aspects of creating video that leads to\naction, and techniques to ensure a video gets shared.\nCreating a short video that has meaningful impact might seem\ndaunting but isn’t impossible. Effective storytelling requires distilling the\nmessage you want to get across without diluting its importance. Stories that\nmake an impact are honest, connect emotionally, and open a dialogue with the viewer.\nA story should connect to the organization’s value proposition and invite the\nviewer to join the organization. The story does not end when the on-screen\naction comes to a conclusion, instead it continues when the viewer joins the\norganization. The invitation to join, or call to\naction, gives viewers a task that involves them in the continuing narrative\nof the story. A good call to action is simple, feels valuable to the cause, and\nopens the door for further engagement.\nCreating a video with impact requires developing a story concept\nand turning it into a script. One expert tip offered by Samala is to share your\nstory concept in conversation and note where your listener reacts before\ncommitting to a script. A story need not be linear, according to Bonifer, and deviating\nfrom a linear structure leaves stories open to be built upon.\nThere are many\nways to tell a story and most organizations already have some of the\ningredients at their disposal to get started. Testimonials,\nfor instance, can be immensely powerful, particularly if they employ\ncharismatic volunteers or constituents. Larger stories can be broken down into\nshorter stories that give the viewer something to come back to.\nOnce a video is developed it needs to be easy to find on",

The artists who draw cartoons are known as cartoonists.\nThe term has evolved over time. The original meaning was in fine art, where cartoon meant a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting or tapestry. The modern meaning refers to both humorous illustrations in print and animated films. Even more recently, there are several contemporary meanings, including creative visual work for electronic media and animated digital media. When the word cartoon is applied to print media, it most often refers to a humorous single-panel drawing or gag cartoon, most of which have typeset captions rather than speech balloons. The word cartoon is sometimes used to refer to a comic strip, and it can also refer to a humorous illustration for fiction or nonfiction published in newspapers and magazines.\"\nOther definitions are: (source: google dictionary)\n- A simple drawing showing the features of its subjects in a humorously exaggerated way, esp. a satirical one in a newspaper or magazine\n- A comic strip\n- A simplified or exaggerated version or interpretation of something\n- this movie is a cartoon of rural life in America\n- Dolores becomes a cartoon housewife, reading glossy magazines in a bathrobe\n- A motion picture using animation techniques to photograph a sequence of drawings rather than real people or objects\n- A full-size drawing made by an artist as a preliminary design for a painting or other work of art.\n- A picture, description, or imitation of a person or thing in which certain striking characteristics are exaggerated in order to create a comic or grotesque effect\n- The art or style of such exaggerated representation\n- there are elements of caricature in the portrayal of the hero\n- A ludicrous or grotesque version of someone or something\n- he looked like a caricature of his normal self\nWhat does cartoon and caricature mean for ECC Cartoonbooks Club?\nThe 'core business' of our blog does not include comic strip or comics and animated cartoons nor books about these subjects. Other blogs and websites will inform you about this matter.\nTo keep it simple, this is what we understand under 'cartoon' and 'caricature':\n-",
      "1 1 The 5 Key Strategies of Attracting High-End Clients How marketing and selling to High-End Clients can transform your business and your income. Hi, my name is Robert Middleton, the owner of Action Plan Marketing. Since 1984 I ve been working with Independent Professionals such as management consultants, business coaches and corporate trainers to help them attract more clients. For years, my primary goal was to simply help clients be better marketers of their services. I helped them get past the struggle and effort or marketing and implement marketing strategies and tactics that really worked. But for years I was missing one of the most important things of all. I wasn t paying much attention to the kind of clients my clients were attracting. That is, whether the clients they were attracting were ordinary clients or high-end clients. To make a long story short, what I discovered was that it didn t take a lot more work to attract high-end clients. And when I started to teach my clients to attract high-end clients, their income shot up as well as their fulfillment in working with their clients.\n2 2 In this five-part report I m going to explain the most important secrets to attracting high-end clients. This could be the most important report you ll read in your business this year (sure, everyone says that), but I know it s true because when you master the art of attracting high-end clients, you ll transform your whole business. You ll have more money, more time, and more satisfaction that the work you re doing makes a difference. The first part covers the basics of attracting high-end clients, how to define high-end clients and the three essential ingredients of attracting high-end clients. Part I - Attracting High-End Clients Everyone wants to attract more clients. But I think it s even more important to set your sights on attracting more high-end clients. Right now, I m working with 20 high-end clients through my Marketing Mastery Program. This transition from average clients to high-end clients over the past few years has transformed my business and my lifestyle. I define high-end clients in the following three ways: 1. They are ideal clients. That is, clients you can really make\n3 3 a difference with and whom you love to work with. 2. They are long-term clients. These are clients with whom you can offer programs and services for a year or more. 3. They are high-paying clients. They understand the value you offer and are willing to pay you more than average clients will",
      "I posted this only a few months ago but in light of today's news with Berni Wrightson's health issues causing him to retire I figured I would share it again. 'Jenifer' is arguably one of Wrightson's most infamous horror works. It first appeared in Creepy #63. For those interested this was made into an episode of 'Masters of Horror' directed by Dario Argento. If I have the time and resources I may try to post further Wrightson comics in the future.\nWarning for gore as well as a rape scene.\n( Story under the cut... )\nTo celebrate Halloween this year, I've posted a bunch of my favorite Steve Ditko horror comics covers, all from his Charlton days. I never seem to remember that Ditko's birthday is a couple of days after Halloween (On Nov. 2nd, he turns 82).Well, I remembered this time, and although there isn't a terribly strong connection between both of these themes, it's more reason to post some Ditko. Additionally, one of his classic collaborations with Archie Goodwin, \"Room With a View\", is also included here. Just follow the cut for horror covers and comics at their finest.\n( Ditko's Horror Comics )\nWarren's CREEPY and EERIE started out like gangbusters, black & white horror comics illustrated by hall of fame artists. Some CREEPY and EERIE stories were better than some EC (which had their share of duds, like anyone). But after Archie Goodwin left, Warren magazines ran to the edge of the quality cliff and jumped off. By the time 1984 was started (imitating HEAVY METAL, I suppose), things were dire. The magazine had lots of decent art, but the stories were gross-outs aiming at being offensive rather than provocative, crass rather than thought-provoking. There was almost nothing in 1984 (which changed to 1994 after the George Orwell estate had something to say) worth saving. But I did like REX HAVOC (AND THE ASS-KICKERS OF THE FANTASTIC).\nWith the '1/3 fair use' rules being extended to short stories as well, I've decided to end my Warren posts. In my opinion, it would not work for the majority of the remaining stories--if you have a six page story, for example, only showing two pages would be hard, mainly because I would be recapping",
      "The opinion of the court was delivered by: Terry J. Hatter, Jr. Senior United States District Judge\nDuring a seven month period between August, 2004, and February, 2005, Petitioner molested the 12-year-old daughter of his girlfriend. Some of the incidents were videotaped. One evening, when Petitioner's girlfriend came home from work, she noticed the video camera. She turned it on and saw her daughter orally copulating the Petitioner. Petitioner's girlfriend took the video camera and tape, fled Petitioner's home, and called the police.\nPetitioner was found guilty on thirty counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under the age of fourteen and was sentenced to an aggregated term of 133 years: Twelve years for count 1; Consecutive four-year terms for counts 2-30; and a five-year enhancement for a prior serious felony.\nThree of petitioner's habeas corpus claims have been stricken. Petitioner, now, seeks a writ of habeas corpus on the remaining issues, claiming that: (1) Consecutive terms denied the Petitioner's right to a fair trial because they were based on the judge's determination of aggravating factors without a jury finding on the issues; and (2) The imposed sentence violates the Constitution's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), provides that a federal court may grant habeas relief if a state court adjudication resulted in a decision that (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\nPetitioner contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by finding aggravating factors to support consecutive sentences without a finding by a jury.\nThe Sixth Amendment requires juries, not judges, to find facts relevant to sentencing. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 756, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005).

      "860 Scaevola sericeaCommon Names: beach naupaka, sea lettuce, half-flower, Hawaiian half-flower Family: Goodeniacea (scaevola Family)\nBeach naupaka is a robust bushy evergreen shrub to 10 ft (3.1 m) tall and about as wide. Its habit is a dense, multibranched mound of light green foliage. Branches root where they touch the ground. The leaves are 3-6 in (7.6-15.2 cm) long and crowded at the tips of the twigs. Beach naupaka is sometimes called half-flower because the flowers have petals on just one side, like a hand fan. The five petals are white to pale violet. It blooms most of the year with a peak in summer. The mature fruits are fleshy white drupes about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long. Beach naupaka is similar to the native herbaceous shrub, inkberry or beachberry (Scaevola plumieri), which is listed as a Threatened Species by the State of Florida. The native species is smaller and less woody, has more succulent leaves that are just 1-3 in (2.5-7.6 cm) long and has black fruits.\nBeach naupaka occurs naturally on beaches and atolls throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. It often forms dense thickets on seaside cliffs and sand dunes. Beach naupaka is highly invasive and has become a troublesome weed in South Florida where it was was first reported in 1976, apparently introduced from Hawaii. In South Florida, beach naupaka has established itself on sand dunes and coastal hammocks, displacing native species, and is quickly becoming one of the most common shrubs along the South Florida coast.\nCultureAs evidenced by its ability to rapidly colonize much of the coastal South Florida environment, beach naupaka is an adaptable shrub and one that is easy to grow. Light: Full sun. Moisture: Beach naupaka is drought tolerant. Hardiness: USDA Zones 10 - 11. Propagation: Beach naupaka is propagated from seed. The fruits float and the seeds remain viable for more than a year in sea water. However, they will germinate only with fresh water. No doubt the plant also could be propagated by division.\nBeach naupaka was formerly promoted",

      "Eight Luxuries You Should Buy for Your Car\nCars are expensive enough, gobbling ever-pricier fuel, but there are times when even automotive skinflints should consider loosening their grip on that dollar.\nCars are expensive enough, gobbling ever-pricier fuel, but there are times when even automotive skinflints should consider loosening their grip on that dollar. We've identified some purchases -- for car shoppers and car owners -- where the payoff's worth the extra expense. Don't cheat yourself out of safety or the joy of driving.\nTires are notoriously hard to shop for, being universally round and black. Many folks just throw up their hands and buy the cheapest thing that can keep their rims off the pavement. Big mistake: Tires are the single most important thing you can purchase to affect the safety, handling and ride of your car.\nWe can't tell you exactly what the best tires are for your car: That's part of the problem -- it varies. You'll need to do some homework, and this tool from online vendor The Tire Rack can help. One tip: As you shop around, don't make the tire's wear rating (how long it lasts) your top priority. Look instead for a top traction and temperature rating. Those indicate how well the tires will stick to wet roads and run at high speed under a heavy load (basically, an indication of the tire's resistance to blowing out). Surely that matters more than getting a few more miles out of your donuts.\n- SEE ALSO: Get Quality Tires for the Best Price\nBuilt-In Navigation System\nA built-in navigation system can add thousands to the cost of a new car, and that gives many folks pause, especially if they're already holding a GPS in their hand -- their mobile phone. But dealing with a phone as navigation device while driving can be fiddly and dangerous. You wouldn't text while you were driving, right? (Don't answer that.)\nThe top reason to buy the factory system is safety: not just because navigating with a built-in system is easier, but because it frequently serves as a big screen for a rearview camera. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that nearly 200 people are killed each year in back-over accidents. Also, the screen typically serves as a multifunction display that allows you to control your music, climate, and other aspects of your ride more easily (and easier means safer, thanks to less time with your eyes off the road).\nA Nicer Towel\nNo, not for you, silly -- for the car. For some people, washing the car means taking it to the car wash. For others, it's a driveway ritual involving exotic potions and cotton swabs. And for a lot of us, it's just another chore to squeeze in on the weekend. But you can make that task a whole lot more pleasant, and better for your car, with one of the new microfiber drying cloths. It's a splurge not to use those free old bath towels, but the $10 - $20 you shell out for a few of these will save you time and laundry, and reduce the risk of scratching your paint. A friend swears by Meguiar's Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.\nThe federal government has mandated electronic stability control (including antilock brakes and traction control) for all 2012 cars and light trucks. So, that's taken care of. Still, on many cars, there remain options that can enhance your safety. Consider:\n-- Blind-spot information systems. Using cameras or radar, these systems let you know if there's something lurking over your shoulder, with a light in or near the mirror -- or by beeping if you put on your turn signal.\n-- Collision avoidance systems. There's a car stopping short ahead and you're not paying enough attention (that phone?). But your car is: As the distance closes, it senses that you're running out of time to stop and tightens the seatbelts, makes the brakes more sensitive, pops up any headrests that have been folded down and closes the sunroof -- and warns you with lights and sounds. Some will even go ahead and brake if the situation seems dire enough. These systems are mostly found on high-end luxury cars, but you can add it to one of Kiplinger's 2012 Best in Class picks, the Ford Taurus SHO, as well as the Toyota Sienna minivan.\n-- High-intensity discharge xenon headlights. It's rare that these brighter, whiter-burning bulbs aren't part of some other options package, but maybe you should use the safety margin they bring to go ahead and justify the sunroof that comes along with it.\nWindshield Wiper Blades\nMost new vehicles feature \"beam-type\" windshield wiper blades. Owners of older cars can catch up to this technology when it's time to replace wipers, as blade manufacturers such as Trico and Bosch have developed replacement blades that fit your car.",
      "All across the nation, families are struggling to get ahead. For some, the rising costs of healthcare chip away at their gains. For others, stagnating wages and college bills are a real problem.\nThen there are those who claim raising kids makes it impossible to grow wealth.\nNo matter where you go, you’ll hear stories of hardship – many of which are out of our control.\nBut, what if I told you some financial pain in this country is self-inflicted? What if I told you one financial decision in particular has been absolutely catastrophic for people at every income?\nWhat if I suggested one simple change that could turn your finances upside down (in a good way)?\nIf you’re still reading this post, you asked for it.\nBrace yourself; you might not like what you’re about to hear.\nThe One Monthly Payment Killing Your Wealth\nThe average car payment in US is now $499. That is straight up stupid. That much invested would be over $5M at retirement.\n— Dave Ramsey (@DaveRamsey) September 15, 2016\nAccording to a recent State of the Automotive Finance Study from Experian, the average new car payment reached $523 per month last quarter. Worse, the average new car loan is 68 months long! Like my man Dave Ramsey says, it’s entirely preposterous when you really think about it.\nHave you ever imagined what you could do with an extra $499 per month? Let’s face it; probably not. These days, we blame everything but our car payments for our inability to get ahead.\nWe blame our employers for not giving us the raises we deserve, or our parents for not educating us enough. We blame health insurance premiums, the price of groceries, the housing market, and even the price of gas. But, do we ever throw shade at our car payments? Heavens no.\nSomewhere along the line, we’ve become socially conditioned to believe a huge car payment is a fact of life. We tell ourselves that everyone has a car payment, and that it’s normal and okay. And heck, if we’re going to have a car payment, we might as well get the car we want, right?\nThis kind of thinking is so widespread it’s practically an epidemic. The thing is, it’s also absolutely wrong….and it's killing our wealth.\nWhy the $500 Car Payment is a Bad Idea\nI’m not saying all car payments are bad, as there are certain situations where a loan makes sense. Perhaps you really needed a new car under warranty and saved up a large down payment to make it happen. Or maybe you planned on buying a new car with cash, but chose financing to secure a sweet 0% APR financing offer.\nBut, let's face it - these situations aren't normal. While each situation is unique, the vast majority of people aren’t helped by their ginormous car payment.\nIn fact, a huge monthly payment might be the one thing preventing them from building wealth. Think about it this way. Imagine you started your first job at age 25 and settled on a $499 car payment for your entire adult life.\nYou would trade your car in over the years, but you would always have that payment. Each time you paid a car off, you would head straight to the dealership to pick up a new one.\nIf you did this for thirty years, you would fork over $179,640 in car payments!\nAnd in the end, you would only have an older car worth almost nothing to show for it. Worse, this figure doesn’t include the extra money you’ll pay for auto insurance and register a brand new car as opposed to a used one. Now imagine you did something radical. You forgo a new car for your entire life and drive older, paid-off models the entire time.\nInstead of spending $179,640 in car payments over thirty years, you limit yourself to spending $30,000 total on cars instead. The kicker with this scenario is, you invest all of the extra money instead. (I did this with an inherited Chevy Lumina, and became $2 million dollars wealthier in the process!)\nIf you did this – and invested around $1,000 less per year to save up the $30,000 for a lifetime of car replacements – you would have $394,335.91 after thirty years with just a 6 percent annual return. If you earned 8 percent on your money over those thirty years, you would turn 55 with $565,047.59! Now let’s say you earned 10 percent on your money.\nAmazingly, you would have $820,483.03 after thirty years! Remember, this is easy money, people. Instead of paying that car payment, you would either:\n- Boost contributions to your work-sponsored ",
      "You’ve waited, you’ve wondered, you’ve suspected … and now it’s finally here: The Windows 8 Release Preview, Microsoft’s new, near-final look at its next operating system. As expected, the Release Candidate represents a major new milestone towards the release of Windows 8. And if you’ve got questions about what’s changed, good news: I have the answers. And I like to share.\nThis article can be considered the front-end to what you will soon discover is the start of a wave of Windows 8 Release Preview coverage that will occur over the next few days. As I did with the Consumer Preview (in Welcome to the Windows 8 Consumer Preview), I’m breaking down what I’ve learned into multiple articles, over multiple days, so you can more easily find what you’re looking for. So consider this discussion a high level overview where I’ll link to other articles where you can find more information.\nAnd then come back tomorrow. There will be more. :)\nFirst, be sure to check out my Windows 8 Release Preview commentary, It’s Here! The Windows 8 Release Preview Arrives. Given the crazy opinions and pontifications we’ve seen since the Consumer Preview, I thought it was time to step back, take a deep breath, and start evaluating Windows 8 on its own merits. More opinion than review, this article speaks to the emotional side of the technology we all love so much.\nWhile my many Release Preview articles are peppered with screenshots that show off individual features, I know that many readers are eager for higher resolution, higher quality shots as well. So here’s a heaping helping of what the Windows 8 Release Preview looks like, something to gaze at while you download this latest milestone build: Windows 8 Release Preview: Screenshot Gallery.\nI’ve also prepared a second screenshot gallery showing off all 25 new Metro-style color schemes. Check out Windows 8 Release Preview: Metro Color Schemes Screenshot Gallery for the full scoop.\nAs the most mature aspect of Windows 8, you won’t be surprised to discover that Windows Setup hasn’t changed much since the Consumer Preview. But there are many small change changes plus one notable addition: You can now choose from far more Metro color schemes than was possible in the Consumer Preview. (Building up to the Release Candidate, Microsoft had added a helpful if short video at the end of the Out of Box Experience, or OOBE, which was aimed at helping new users get up to speed on interacting with the hidden Metro interfaces. This was removed for the Release Preview, however.)\nYou can find out more about the differences in Changes to Windows Setup.\nNew navigation choices\nThis isn’t a Release Preview feature per se, but I’ve been sitting on this information for week and now have actual hardware to test: In addition to supporting traditional mouse and keyboard interfaces, multi-touch, and of course style/pen input types in Windows 8, Microsoft is also working with major trackpad vendors to support indirect gesture support in its next operating system. This means that all Windows 8-based PCs that ship with trackpads will include the ability to use gestures on the device’s trackpad, giving them a subset of the functionality one would get with a multi-touch screen. Curious how this works? I’ve got the full rundown in New Trackpad Gesture Support.\nAdding new features to Windows 8\nSince releasing the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, Microsoft revealed the various product editions it would provide as well as its plan to replace the Windows Anytime Upgrade functionality from previous versions with a new feature called Add Features to Windows 8 that will let users of the base Windows 8 version upgrade in-place to Windows 8 Pro and other functionality. I show you how this new type of upgrade works in Add Features to Windows 8.\nAs the most prominent of the new Metro-style user experiences, the Start Screen is also the most hotly debated among the tech illuminati. But let’s not forget who this experience is aimed at—typical users—and at least give Microsoft a bit of credit for not changing the Start screen all that much since the Consumer Preview. In Changes to the Start Screen, I describe the changes that are present, however, including those to the tiles, background patterns, color schemes, semantic zoom, app bar, and settings. (And if you’re looking for a more visual guide, be sure to check out my Metro Color Schemes Screenshot Gallery, where you can see and compare all 25 of the new color schemes present in this release.)\nIntroducing the new Metro-style apps: News, Sports and Travel\nWhile I had previously teased the fact that Microsoft would include three new Metro-style apps in the Windows 8 Release Preview—News, Sports, and Travel—in Yes, There Are Three New Apps In The Windows 8 Release Preview and Windows 8 Secrets: News App, it’s time to take a slight deeper dive into these three interesting new additions. At first glance, News, Sports, and Travel are nothing more than glorified RSS reader apps that",
      "One Failure Away From Success\nDid you know that you might be one failure away from success? When starting a new business, it is inevitable that you are going to experience many mistakes and small failures. However, you can either choose to learn from these setbacks or you can fall victim to them and throw in the towel. I urge you to stay the course and keep striving towards your goal!\nYou have to know what success is to know what failure is and vice versa. Nobody ever thinks that they might be one success away from failure. Success is a great motivator. We need to let failure be an even bigger motivator if we want real success. You are probably one failure away from success right now.\nI will share with you six failures that I endured but still came out on top. It may be uncomfortable to admit a mistake or failure; but I want to empower you to know that while negative events may happen, you can still accomplish great things. The outcome is up to you.\n1. Saved Credit Card\nMy passion project has also been my biggest learning project. This company is a cycling apparel brand called Heavy Pedal which began in 2008. In the early days, I tried various eCommerce platforms to figure out which of them I liked the most. I came across a platform called Magento; I would not recommend this platform at all.\nIt is far too complicated. There are too many options and the user interface is poorly designed. In my case, there was an option for payment called “Saved Credit Card.” I paid a developer to set Magento up so I didn’t know the functionality of this payment option or why it was selected. This option saves the customer’s credit card information and you have to process the payment manually. Since I was unaware of this, I was basically giving away 50% of all orders and paying to ship them out. This went on for months before I wondered why there were little profits to re-stock more products.\n2. Moving Away\nIn the early days of the brand, I moved from Phoenix, Arizona to San Diego, California to work full-time for a bicycle brand. I packed up my belongings and all the Heavy Pedal inventory and headed for a commuter culture, the beach and better weather. Over time, not being able to work directly with Victor (Heavy Pedal designer) proved to be stressful and problematic for us personally as well as the brand. It was difficult to stay focused on a shared vision when you are not working in the trenches together.\n3. Noncompete / Cease & Desist\nI moved back to Phoenix, Arizona for an opportunity to work with another company in a different landscape of the cycling industry. Part of the agreement was for me to sign a non-compete. Heavy Pedal was already an existing cycling brand so I never thought that our product pivot into bicycles would put us into direct competition with this brand. Ironically, when looking for factories to make our bikes, I surveyed other brands in this space and finally found a reputable manufacturer— too bad they also made bikes for my former employer. As a result, Heavy Pedal was unable to work with this manufacturer on our bikes. Due to complications with bike manufacturing we decided to stick to cycling apparel which proved to be the best decision we could have ever made.\n4. Cease & Desist\nWe once made a water bottle that purposefully resembled the iconic Jack Daniel’s label. We thought it was a cool looking nod to the iconic brand and our customers thought so too. It received some viral notoriety online which was fantastic. At some point, this bottle design got into the hands of Jack Daniel’s and they sent a Cease and Desist asking for us to remove the product and stop sales immediately. I must say that they were very professional and kind about the whole thing. A brand of that size could have crushed us if they really wanted to.\n5. Hooray, Investors\nThere is a known saying in the startup world,\n“If you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money.”\nAfter meeting with a mentor for advice about my business, he decided to co-invest with his partner. This was after they reviewed and saw an opportunity with sales, projections, and my future plans for Heavy Pedal. Unfortunately, about 2 months post-investment, we were sued by a competitor that was trying to stop our momentum and the investors decided to pull out. At the time, I was disappointed in the court system and the flighty investors. In retrospect, I understand why the investors flew the coop and it turned out to be a good thing. I have full ownership of the brand again and we are doing better than ever.\n6. Six-Figure Lawsuit\nAs previously mentioned, I was sued by a former employer who claimed that I signed a non-compete agreement which I had not. They made several claims that were not true. To name a few, they claimed that during my employment years I stole information, took trade secrets, and reverse engineered their products. Luckily for",
      "Sweet and Stout: How to pair beer with desserts\nWith the recent microbrewery mania, beer experts have found ways to incorporate beer with almost anything — even dessert.\nJust in time for St. Patrick’s Day on March 17, Bonnie Watson, Craft Beer Cellar’s director of education and certified cicerone — a sommelier of beers — paired classic desserts with craft beers. Chocolate chip cookies? A malty German doppelbock. Cheesecake? A carbonated sour cherry beer.\nWatson said the three primary pairing goals are to complement, enhance or contrast. When tasting, first take a sip of beer. Then take a bite of dessert. Mid-bite, take another sip of beer and let the flavors unfold.\nA good rule of thumb is the richer the cake, the heavier the beer. With chocolate cakes, beers can complement or add flavors, Watson said.\nChocolate cake lovers can pull out more chocolate flavors by pairing it with an imperial stout.\nAnother option is a carbonated fruit beer such as a raspberry ale. The carbonation will scrub off the thick chocolate icing that sticks to the tongue and roof of the mouth.\n“Chocolate cake is rich, sweet, a little bitter just because there’s some dark chocolate in there,” Watson said. The tart raspberry beer’s sweetness pairs with the chocolate cake because it is reminiscent of a chocolate-covered raspberry.\nWatson recommends Founder’s Rubeaus in a tulip glass.\nCarrot cake calls for a beer that contrasts with the sweet cream cheese frosting and spices in the cake. Watson suggests an India pale ale. IPA, citrusy and mostly bitter, will calm the icing’s sweetness and pair nicely with the cake, she said.\nWatson recommends Boulevard Calling IPA or Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA in a tall tulip.\nWith cheesecake, Watson recommends a sour carbonated fruit beer. She describes this beer as full of rich sour cherry notes with a hint of oak.\nCheesecakes are thick and creamy and have that cream cheese funk to it, she said. Rich desserts such as cheesecake need a carbonated beer to wash out the mouth.\n“Sour” fruit beers “balance out the sweetness from the cream cheese and complement it,” Watson said. The cheesecake and beer will taste as if the cherries were drizzled all over the cheesecake itself.\nAll lambic beers begin as wheat beers, aged in oak vats and left to ferment. In a cherry lambic, cherries are added and fermented until only pits remain, giving the lambic an intense cherry flavor.\nWatson recommends Petrus Aged Red in a chalice.\nButter Pecan Ice Cream\nFor butter pecan ice cream, Watson likes a brown ale made with nuts or oatmeal and high in carbonation. Oatmeal notes play especially well with the buttery flavor of the ice cream.\nWatson recommends Southern Pecan ale or 4 Hands Cast Iron Oatmeal in a shaker pint.\nWatson said she loves apple pie for its spices, nutmeg and cinnamon. To highlight the apple flavors in the pie, she pairs it with a light sour wheat beer.\n“When you bite into an apple pie, the spice just hits you,” Watson said. With the beer, “You want to emphasize the apple, not so much the spices.”\nWatson recommends Pomme Lambic in a teku glass.\nChocolate Chip Cookies\nWith chocolate chip cookies, the cookie is more predominant than the chocolate. To complement cookies, Watson suggests something malty to bring out the dark chocolate chips. A German doppelbock would be best.\n“The cookie, especially a crunchy one, will work well with malt flavors because as you chew, more things will start to evolve,” Watson said. “The brown sugar in the cookie will pull out the brown sugars in the beer.”\nIn a doppelbock, the rich, dark ale’s maltiness will come through as toffee or molasses, bringing out subtle cocoa flavors in the beer, which makes it similar to liquefied cocoa.\nSee chocolate chip cookie recipe below.\nWatson recommends Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock in a goblet.\nMint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream\nMint’s best friend is chocolate, which is why it pairs well with a carbonated, low-alcohol stout. The stout has no adjunct flavors and will be hearty enough to stand up to the mint.\n“You’ll get some of those chocolate flavors from the malt,” Watson said. “The nice roasty element of the beer will be a nice backbone for mint to lean up against.”\nWatson recommends Public House Revelation Stout or 4 Hands Chocolate Milk Stout in a shaker pint.\nKey Lime Pie\nWatson suggests a light German wheat beer high in carbonation, which will cut through the rich thickness of the pie’s creamy filling.\n“Despite being light on the palate and quite drinkable, the beer has a high carbonation and a light banana flavor, which comes from the special yeast used,” Watson said.

      "A massive campaign has been mounted in the UK to lure a trainee general practitioner (GP) to Bangladesh by her family and detained there in an attempt to force her to marry someone against her will. She is also being tortured in an attempt to terrorise her into submission.\nDr Humayra Abedin, known as Dorothy to her friends, this weekend faces being forced to marry a complete stranger, unless efforts by lawyers to free her, using new powers, succeed. Dr Abedin is being held hostage by her family in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, where she is thought to have been gagged, bound and violently beaten to get her to comply with her parents' wishes.\nThe 33-year-old trainee GP is depressed, suicidal and without hope, according to an email she managed to send to a close friend last Friday. This is the first time friends have heard from Dr Abedin for more than three months.\nAnne-Marie Hutchinson, the barrister from Renaissance Chambers acting for Dr Abedin, said: \"There are real concerns for the safety of this young woman. It is understood that she is to be married this weekend. The Forced Marriage Act offers protection to all residents of this country. It makes it clear that because she lives here it is not just a domestic matter for the Bangladesh authorities.\"\nWhile the Act is not enforceable in Bangladesh, lawyers for Dr Abedin are confident it will strengthen the resolve of the authorities in Dhaka, Nina Lakhani reported for the Independent.\nThe only child of Mohammed Joynal Abedin, a retired businessman, and his wife,a housewife, Dr Abedin trained as a doctor in Bangladesh and then went to England in 2002 to study at Leeds University. She has since set up home in Leyton, east London,while working in hospitals across the capital. Dr Abedin is described by friends as an intelligent young woman who loves Bollywood films and Hindi music. She is only a year away from qualifying as a GP.\nHer Muslim family became incensed after she developed a close friendship with a Hindu Bangladeshi man she met in London. Since May, they have made several attempts to keep her away from him and to force her into marriage. The Metropolitan Police launched an inquiry at the end of June, after she was held captive in her flat by her mother and uncle, who visited for several days. Her case has also been taken up by Interpol. Her family duped her into returning to Bangladesh in August, by claiming her mother was seriously ill. They then hid her passport and plane ticket, and have held her captive since 5 August. She has been subjected to physical and psychological violence and denied contact with friends or lawyers. There are also unconfirmed claims that Dr Abedin has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital at the wishes of her parents, who have insinuated in court that her relationship with a Hindu man is a sign of mental illness.\nDeprived of any access to a telephone or internet, Dr Abedin somehow managed to send an e-mail to a close friend last Friday. The tone of the e-mail conveys the desperation of her plight. She wrote: \"I wish I could see you once in my lifetime. This is the only wish I have. Most important thing is Please try to forgive me if you can. I AM SORRY. Please don't hate me. My life is already ruined. I don't care any more. I just want to end my life as nothing left to live and look forward to. You are one of the best person. I will always remember you. I wanted to grow old with you. It will never happen now.\"\nDr Abedin is one of hundreds of young British men and women who are thought to be forced into marriages every year. In the first nine months of this year, the Government's Forced Marriage Unit was contacted by 1,308 concerned callers fearing they or someone close to them might be forced into marriage. The unit directly helped 388 of these victims - nearly twice as many as in 2007.\nThe Ministry of Justice minister, Bridget Prentice, said: \"I am delighted that the courts have already begun to make use of the Forced Marriage Order toprevent forced marriage. This is very significant and demonstrates quite clearly that the Act will make a real difference to the lives of some of the mostvulnerable people in our society. I expect the Act to send a clear message that forced marriage is a fundamental abuse of human rights and will not be tolerated. Forced marriage, like other forms of domestic violence, isunderreported, so we do not know the full extent of the problem.\n\"Lawyers acting for Dr Abedin's cousin are pursuing the case in Bangladesh. The High Court in Dhaka has for the fourth time ordered her parents and uncle- who are in contempt of court - to bring her before the judge on 14December. The cousin, Dr Shipra Chaudhury, is said to be under huge pressure to withdraw",
      "Good Schools, Books, a Love of Mechanics, and You Must Earn a Living\nAbout 1900 my parents came to the United States as children from what was then the Polish area of Russia. As Jews, their families left Russia to escape the poverty and the antisemitism. My parents grew up in poor areas of New York City, my father Oscar Perl in the East Side district of Manhattan and my mother Fay Rosenthal in the Brownsville district of Brooklyn. Their educations ended with high school – my father going to work as a clerk and then salesman in a company dealing in printing and stationary, and my mother working as a secretary and then bookkeeper in a firm of wool merchants.\nMy parents were determined to move into the middle class. By the time my sister, Lila Perl, and I were born in the 1920’s, my father had established a printing and advertising company called Allied Printing. For many years, Allied Printing was a precarious business. I remember conversations at the dinner table about the problem of meeting the upcoming Friday payroll. However, Allied Printing brought the four of us into the middle class and kept us in the middle class thru the Depression of the 1930’s. We lived in the better neighborhoods of the borough of Brooklyn, not the fanciest neighborhoods, but quite good neighborhoods, and so we went to quite good schools.\nThese schools and the attitude of my parents towards these schools were important in preparing me for the work of an experimental scientist. Going to school and working for good marks, indeed working for very good marks, was a serious business. My parents regarded school teachers as higher beings, as did many immigrants. School principals were gods to be worshiped but never seen by children or parents. Parents never visited the school to talk about the curriculum or to meet with their child’s teacher. A parent being called to the school because their child had misbehaved was as serious as a parent being called to the police station because their child had robbed a bank. The remoteness of my parents from the schools, so unfashionable today, was often painful for me, but I learned early to deal with an outside and sometimes hard world. Good training for research work! The experimenter dealing with nature faces an outside and often hard world. Natures’ curriculum cannot be changed.\nThe curricula were unsophisticated, with a great deal of time wasted on penmanship and geography in the early grades and repetitions of the trivial history of New York City in higher grades. But there were also serious courses. In my high school, two foreign languages had to be studied, four years of English was required, and that meant mostly grammar and composition. I was able to take four years of mathematics and a year of physics. Whatever the course, whether the course was boring or interesting to me, whether I was talented in mathematics or not talented in languages, my parents expected A’s. This was good training for research, because large parts of experimental work are sometimes boring or involve the use of skills in which one is not particularly gifted.\nFor example, I am not a good craftsman. Until recently when I could use computer-based drafting programs, my drawings always looked messy, with uneven lines and ragged lettering. I could never get an “A” in drafting in college. Yet drawing the apparatus to be built for my experiments has always been a crucial part of my experimental work.\nThere was compensation for the unsophisticated curriculum; with good marks one could “skip” school years. The normal progression was to begin the eight years of elementary school at six years of age, and then to take four years of high school, leading to graduation at eighteen. But classrooms were crowded, and there were no worries about the proper social level of a student; a good student could skip a year or more in elementary school. I was sixteen when I graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn in 1942. My sister, who is now a well known writer in the United States, moved through school even faster – she graduated at fifteen and one-half.\nAlong with my parents insistence, soon internalized, that I do very well in school, went my love of reading and my love of mechanics. I read everything: fiction, history, science, mathematics, biography, travel. There were two free public libraries within walking distance of my home; I remember taking six books home from every visit, the limit set by the library. This reading had only partial approval from my parents. They wanted me to play more sports because they were acutely sensitive to their children being one hundred percent American, and they believed that all Americans played sports and loved sports. They felt that too much reading interfered with my going outside to play sport. I loved rainy days when I did not have to go outside, and to the present I still feel very content on a rainy day.\nTwo books are burned in my memory, Lancelot Hogben’s Mathematics for the Millions and his Science for the Citizen. I borrowed them from",

      "The World That Never Was\nThe world of Organization XIII, it is home to a seemingly endless supply of Heartless and Nobodies. The Heartless seem to spawn more here due to how close The World That Never Was is to the darkness of Kingdom Hearts. The Organization controls the world from the Castle That Never Was, a massive fortress that floats weightlessly over the expansive Dark City.\nSettings and Areas\nKingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\nThe Alley to Between (狭間につながる路地, Hazama ni Tsunagaru Roji?) hides a portal to Betwixt and Between. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and King Mickey used this portal to get into the world, thanks to Axel's sacrifice. The alley way connects to the main route that leads to the Castle That Never Was. The first Save Point of the world can be found here.\nExiting the alley leads to the Fragment Crossing (断片を紡ぐ道, Danpen o Tsumugu Michi?, lit. \"Fragment-Spinning Road\"), a long series of winding streets that lead to Memory's Skyscraper. It is full of neon signs attached to vacant buildings as well as a power plant which seems to power some or all of the city. Many Shadow Heartless are here, but in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, they are eventually replaced with Nobodies. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and King Mickey took this route on their way to the Castle That Never Was. Pluto also had an encounter with Axel here.\nFollowing the Fragment Crossing is Memory's Skyscraper (記憶の摩天楼, Kioku no Matenrō?), an imposingly tall building that presides over Dark City, in a plaza near the cliffs surrounding the Castle That Never Was. At its feet lies a plaza staircase leading to glass doors, and on its face is a massive television screen, which displays memories of those nearby in Another side, Another story.... In the corner of the plaza is a wrecked truck, flipped on its side. During his battle with Xemnas, Sora was pulled into an area that included Memory's Skyscraper, called Memory's Contortion, in a battle similar to the one Roxas and Riku had. In Dream Drop Distance, Memory's Skyscraper is accessible only for Riku. However, this is where Sora first landed when he dived into this world before being put to sleep.\nThe left road behind Memory's Skyscraper leads to the Brink of Despair (絶望を望む断崖, Zetsubō o Nozomu Dangai?, lit. \"Cliff Overlooking Despair\"), a cliff with a clear view of the hovering Castle That Never Was. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and King Mickey arrive here and access the castle via a path using the Keyblade. It has the second Save Point of this world in Kingdom Hearts II.\nCastle That Never Was\nThe Castle That Never Was (存在しなかった城, Sonzai Shinakatta Shiro?) is an enormous white castle that floats above the city, dominating its skyline. It is decorated all over with Nobody symbols. It serves as Organization XIII's main base of operations.\nThe World of Nothing\nAfter Xemnas's first defeat within Memory's Contortion, he flees into his Kingdom Hearts. However, a door appears that leads Sora and his friends within that Kingdom Hearts to an area named \"The World of Nothing\". The first area inside the door is The World of Nothing—End's Beginning, a passageway resembling the Dark City where skyscrapers suddenly erupt from the ground in order to repel Sora. A strange black-and-white tunnel leads from this room to a platform looking out on the gigantic Nobody that Xemnas is riding. From there, Sora can climb falling skyscrapers to walkways surrounding the lower cannons of the Nobody, The World of Nothing—Twin Cannons. Once he destroys those, Sora swings his way up to the ship's Energy Core, which is kept in a room appropriately named The World of Nothing—Energy Core. After disabling the ship's energy core, he makes it up The World of Nothing—Xemnas's Throne Room, where Xemnas sits in his Keyblade Armor, enthroned atop the dragon Nobody's head in a chamber equipped with the weapons of the defeated Organization members. After completely destroying the gigantic Nobody, Sora and Riku are left in The World of Nothing (虚無の世界, Kyomu no Sekai?), a nearly-empty void of shifting greys and whites where Xemnas makes his last attempt to destroy them.

Kennedy terminal on Friday, strengthening its case to be considered New York's leading airline.\n\"We are and should be the preferred airline out of New York,\" said Gail Grimmett, Delta's senior vice president for New York. \"We have a great hub out of LaGuardia, which is the preferred airport for local traffic, where we serve 48 of the top 50 business markets (all but Fayetteville and Oklahoma City) and now we have the international hub at JFK.\n\"But it's not just the breadth of network that's important,\" Grimmett added. \"It's the customer service you get. It's the experience you get. It's the service on board that you get. One thing Delta has learned over the years is that you can never stop investing in the customer or the customer experience.\"\nThe expansion of Terminal 4, where Delta is the primary tenant, has added nine new widebody gates, bringing the total on Delta's B Concourse to 19, of which Delta controls 16. Additionally, Delta has built a 24,000-square-foot airport club, the largest club in its system, with an outdoor terrace, as well as a new ticketing area that includes two rows of counters, about 50 kiosks, and a special check-in area for premium customers.\nBetween late Thursday night and early Friday morning, Delta will move much of its operation from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4. Once the job is complete, the carrier will begin work on a smaller $200 million project, adding 11 smaller gates at Terminal 4, enabling it to move its regional jet operation from Terminal 2. \"This will make the customer experience better because the majority of regional jet traffic flows to international,\" Grimmett said. Delta passengers can already connect between terminals \"behind security,\" she noted.\nNew York is the world's biggest aviation travel market, producing $14 billion in annual airline revenue. The vast majority is split between three major airports. In recent years, Delta has moved to gain share and improve facilities at both LaGuardia and JFK. The key steps have been a 2011 deal with\nto trade Washington National slots for LaGuardia slots, and the JFK construction improvements, which have taken three years.\nDelta's LaGuardia hub has 271 daily departures to 63 destinations while the JFK hub has 146 daily departures to 48 destinations. At JFK,\noperate smaller hubs. The biggest New York hub is the\noperation at Newark, with 404 daily departures to 160 destinations including 75 international destinations.\nUnited on Wednesday celebrated the 25th anniversary of Newark's Terminal C, which enabled rapid expansion after it opened on May 22, 1988. Terminal C was built for\n, which in 1986 was acquired by Continental, which merged with United in 2010.\nDelta's history at JFK also involves the disappearance of a historic name. In 1991 Delta acquired major pieces of Pan Am including its Boston-New York-Washington shuttle, its 34 international routes from JFK and Terminal 3, decrepit even then, where Delta stayed for 22 years.\nDelta becomes the last of the JFK hub carriers to open a new terminal. American opened its\n, which cost $1.3 billion, in August 2007. JetBlue opened an $800 million terminal in 2008.\n\"Delta was the last missing piece,\" said Ray Neidl, an aviation consultant with Nexa Capital Partners in Washington. \"Delta was operating in an obsolete terminal. Its new terminal will be a gangbuster.\"\nNeidl said that given the strength of the Newark hub, it's difficult to say that Delta is No. 1 in New York. \"United is so big at Newark,\" he said. \"The main drawback for Delta is that it has some flights at LaGuardia and some at JFK, where it has been hard to feed flights, due to using different terminals.\"\nAviation consultant Bob Mann said United celebrated its Newark anniversary on Wednesday \"to remind everybody that there's another side of the Hudson River. The battle for New York is being waged on both sides of the river, and United is saying 'Hey, it's more convenient for Wall Street (passengers) to go to Newark.'\"\nAs for the country's third major carrier, US Airways \"for a number of years has struggled\" in New York, Robert Isom, executive vice president, said at an investor conference Wednesday. But a pending merger with American will enable the combined carrier to better compete for corporate business in New York, Isom said, noting \"the great facility at JFK is a cornerstone of Oneworld.\" Unfortunately, key partner British Airways does not occupy the same terminal.\nIn fact, despite",

      "- Unfortunately, most breaches are not reported to law enforcement, writes Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.\n- Congress can help close this gap by enacting legislation to create a national standard for reporting cyber incidents that pose significant risk, she writes.\nThe ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline should have been a wakeup call for America.\nA group of cybercriminals infiltrated a company that runs one of the country's largest pipelines, halting operations across the entire Eastern seaboard. The compromise led the federal government to take action to stem the disruptive gasoline shortages felt by Americans up and down the east coast.\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack was not the first of its kind, nor the last. A few weeks later, JBS Foods — one of the world's largest meat distributors — suffered a similar attack. Shortly afterwards, criminals struck Kaseya, a global IT software provider.\nThis string of attacks illustrates the surge in ransomware and digital extortion attacks over the last several years. The collective damage of ransomware is easily in the billions of dollars. The FBI is investigating over 100 different strains of ransomware, each of them with scores of victims.\nSo what will it take for us to recognize that ransomware threatens both our country's public safety and national security? The Justice Department's prosecutors and the FBI have stopped ransomware attacks, shut down computers and services they rely upon, seized ransom and returned it to victims, and prosecuted offenders no matter where in the world they may be. But we won't prosecute our way out of the problem.\nMore needs to be done. Cybercriminals have increased the scale, scope and impact of their nefarious efforts. The simple fact is we cannot go at this problem alone. The growth of \"ransomware-as-a-service\" — allowing sophisticated hackers to sell or lease the tools needed for a ransomware attack to criminal customers — has reduced the technological skill needed to successfully conduct a ransomware attack. Every day, cyber actors are resorting to digital extortion: hacking into a system, stealing sensitive data, and not only holding vital data hostage but also threatening to leak or sell victim data, in an effort to raise the stakes for victims and coerce them to pay these ransoms.\nThis cannot stand. That is why earlier this year, the Department of Justice created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force as part of the Biden's administration's whole-of-government effort to deter and disrupt cyber threats.\nThe goal is to be both more coordinated in our response to these attacks and more assertive in preventing them. Together with our partners, and the FBI, the Task Force allows the Department not only to use all of the tools at our disposal to prevent, disrupt and prosecute these attacks, but also — and perhaps most importantly — it allows us to collaborate with the private sector to better protect our infrastructure from these attacks in the first place.\nToo often after a cyberattack, the victim company struggles with how, whether, and when to contact law enforcement. But if you have an intruder in your home you do not hesitate to call 911, and it is time to think about cyberattacks with the same instinctive response.\nEngagement with the private sector is vital because much of what investigators and prosecutors will know about a ransomware or digital extortion attack depends on what victims tell us — and when. In cases like Colonial, we got their ransom payment back by following the money — a tried and true law enforcement technique that was made possible through quick and thorough reporting followed by close cooperation. As in other cases, this allows us to trace victim funds, recover exfiltrated data, identify perpetrators and prevent future attacks.\nUnfortunately, most breaches are not reported to law enforcement. Absent prompt reporting, investigative opportunities are lost, our ability to assist other victims facing the same threats are degraded, and the government loses the full picture of the threat facing our country. The current gap in reporting hinders the government's ability to combat not just the ransomware threat, but all cybercriminal activity. It means we go at it alone, without key insights from our partners in the private sector, and it needs to change, today.\nCongress can help close this gap by enacting legislation to create a national standard for reporting cyber incidents that pose significant risk, including ransomware and incidents that affect critical infrastructure and their supply chains.\nLegislation should designate a single mechanism where victims can file reports to the federal government to be shared immediately with all relevant federal agencies — with the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security taking the lead on joint rulemaking to ensure its implementation. Reports must be prompt, and should include information about the incident, the means by which the attack occurred, infrastructure that was used, and a description of the systems or data affected.\nIn the case of ransomware, such reporting should also include details about any ransom demand or payment. And victims should not be worse off for helping the government.\nAs we observe Cybersecurity Awareness Month this October, this year's theme could not be more timely: \"Do Your Part. #BeCyberSmart.\" Law enforcement",
      "Sunbathing and Mom&Baby Skin Protection from Linea MammaBaby\nPosted on June 10 2021\nLinea MammaBaby®, a brand by Olcelli Farmaceutici that has been standing alongside families with its baby care and hygiene products since 2012, and Dr. Daniela Sabbioni, pediatrician and allergist of Milan’s pediatric polycenter, have provided practical hints to follow in order to make keep safe from the sun and enjoy your summer by the sea.\nSUNBATHING AND SKIN PROTECTION Sun is a precious ally of the skin and its beneficial effects are numerous, such as the antirachitic action that stimulates vitamin D production – fundamental for its antidepressant effects or the improvement of some dermatoses (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo). However, sun exposition must be controlled and kept under protected condition, at any age but especially for younger children.\n“The amount of melanin produced in early phases of life is minimal and then gradually progresses with the growth. Epidemiological studies have shown that intense exposure to sun in young age (under 15 years old) has harmful effects on skin, leading to increased probability of skin cancer in adulthood” explains Dr. Sabbioni “Both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) have the ability, in different ways, to induce skin cancer: therefore it is necessary to use sunscreens that are protective against the full spectrum of ultraviolet. The protection factor must always be elevate, in addiction suncream must to resist to water, sweat and must be well torelated by the skin. Remember that, especially in kids and in subject with light phototype, erithema and sunburn may occur even in “trivial” sun exposure (such as a walk in the park), so it should be a good habit to apply sunscreen even in the city during summer months”.\nTherefore it is necessary to pay a lot of attention to the hours and the time in which children are exposed to sun: avoid sunbathing between 11:30 and 15:30 due to higher concentration of UV rays; you should always remember to make children wear hats with visor and sunglasses, and to apply sunscreen frequently and generously, every two hours before and/or after bathing.\nSOS STINGS Hot weather and summer season mean also insects and potentially unpleasant bites. Don’t worry, Dr. Sabbioni gives advice for this too: “In order to soothe mosquito’s stings itching, irritation and swelling, ice and antihistamines are sufficient. Talking about wasps, bees and hornets, the matter becomes more serious. Symptoms are many: from simple local disorders, which regress within 24- 48 hours, up to anaphylaxis, in case of allergic subjects (in this case, alert emergency services as soon as possible by calling local emergency number). These insect’s venom can cause vomiting, diarrhea, headache and fever. If you are stung it’s better to remove the sting with tweezers, apply ice and antihistamines/cortisonic cream to soothe inflammation and itching”.\nTicks are another great danger. It is necessary to monitor their bites for a long time: \"Because after 30-40 days it is possible to see a circular skin reaction associated with fever, unwell feeling and muscle pain that should be immediately reported to the pediatrician\" - explains Dr. Sabbioni - \"The tick should be removed with tweezers, trying to grasp it as close as possible to the skin, then making a traction movement in a rotary direction (it should not be \"ripped off\") in order to extract it completely. Then disinfect thoroughly and use antihistamines for itching if necessary\".\nLINEA MAMMABABY®’S SUMMER PRODUCTS\nLinea Mamma Baby® sunscreens are EXCELLENT COMPANIONS DURING LONG sunny days because they are produced taking into account the needs of the most delicate phototypes and guaranteeing maximum protection against both UVB and UVA rays. The line includes specific sunscreens that maintain optimal skin hydration level, both during and after the exposure. The Baby SPF 50+ sunscreen is a water-resistant spray ideal for face and body with a high protection factor and a formula designed for particularly fair skin and for the first days of sun exposure. The Mom SFP 30+ Sunscreen, is a transparent emulsion with a pleasantly soft texture, quickly absorbed and water resistant. The Baby Aftersun, is moisturizing and refreshing, also enriched with aloe vera and neem oil, which is unpleasant to bugs; whilst the Baby Solar Water, with organic extracts of chamomile and witch hazel is perfect to prevent sun irritation and to keep skin and hair well hydrated, as well as to combat dryness caused by saltiness.\nIn addition, there is also the Baby Sun Travel Kit, the small travel size to carry with you every",

      "Towards cellulosic biofuels: Breaking down cellulose without blasting lignin\nTowards cellulosic biofuels: Breaking down cellulose without blasting lignin\nComplete the form below and we will email you a PDF version of \"Towards cellulosic biofuels: Breaking down cellulose without blasting lignin\"\nWALNUT CREEK, Calif.—Feared by realtors and homeowners alike, dry rot due to the fungus Serpula lacrymans causes millions of dollars worth of damage to homes and buildings around the world. This brown rot fungus' capacity to break down the cellulose in wood led to its selection for sequencing by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in 2007, with the goal of identifying the enzymes involved in the degradation process and using the information to improve cellulosic biofuels production.\nAs reported online July 14 in Science Express, an international team of scientists including DOE JGI researchers compared the genome of Serpula lacrymans, the second brown rot fungus to have its genome sequenced, against 10 other published fungal genomes. The DOE JGI sequenced seven of these genomes among them Postia placenta, the first brown rot fungus sequenced. The analysis not only allowed researchers to understand the chemical reactions involved in the mechanism by which Serpula breaks down cellulose, it also sheds light on the role of brown rot fungi in the development of the largest terrestrial ecosystem — the subarctic cool climate boreal forest — and therefore the fungi's role in the global carbon cycle.\n\"It's one of those fungi that everybody knows. It has such an aggressive form of cellulose breakdown,\" said study first author Dan Eastwood of Swansea University. He pointed out that the ability of wood-decaying fungi in general to break down lignocellulose is linked to the co-evolution of boreal forests and fungi. \"It is also important to realize the role of these fungi in the natural environment,\" he said. \"For example, if you go back far enough in time to the period when trees were developing, there was no way to break lignocellulose down, which led to the coal seams we tap today. When the fungi figured out how to break down lignocellulose, the coevolution of the fungi and trees kick-started the carbon cycle again. The ancestor of all wood decay fungi we have today was a white rot and it was fungi derived from this ancestor which kick started the carbon cycle and lignocellulose decomposition. The brown rots evolved later from a white rot ancestry and, because they circumvent the lignin and go straight for the hemicellulose and cellulose, they are considered more efficient and is probably why they have been able to dominate boreal forests in more recent times.\"\nThe analyses of the 48.2-million nucleotide genome of S. lacrymans not only allowed the team to compare the gene families involved in the mechanisms by which brown rot break down cellulose and white rot fungi break down both cellulose and lignin, but also how these processes differ within each category. For example, Eastwood noted that the chemistry Serpula uses is slightly different from the chemistry that goes on in Postia, though in a larger sense between white rot and brown rot, \"what we describe here is a refinement of the genes, what genes are absolutely necessary to break down cellulose,\" he said. \"Part of that is the machinery to break down wood became simpler since brown rot fungi are not breaking down lignin.\"\nStudy senior author Sarah Watkinson of the University of Oxford emphasized the role of brown rot fungi in the global carbon cycle, noting that a third of the carbon sequestered in the soil of boreal forests are composed of the wood residues after the fungi break down the cellulose. \"When it grows in forests, it decays the wood and leaves behind the lignin,\" she said. \"We're very interested in what puts carbon into the soil as the residues of brown rot fungi contribute up to 30 percent of carbon in conifer forest soils, and conifer forests are a very large biome in the world and one of the largest carbon sinks on land. The activity of brown rot is very significant in global carbon cycling and I think that hasn't really been appreciated before.\"\nEastwood added that the work impacts so many different fields, deciding what to do next is \"like being a child in a sweet shop: where do we start?\" One application that Jonathan Schilling, a professor at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the project, sees for the Serpula genome is that it can teach bioenergy researchers about improving the process by which plant biomass is converted for biofuel production. \"What we have right now with current bioconversion processes often resembles a white rot approach,\" he said, \"attacking lignin to get at carbohydrates and then converting them to fuels, chemicals or paper. The brown rot fungi have",
      "The foreskin is a double layer of skin and mucosa. Body fluid between the layers provides lubrication and enables the outer layer to glide frictionlessly over the inner layer and along the shaft. A ridged band of tissue just inside the end of the foreskin is heavily innervated. The foreskin is the location of the areas most sensitive to fine touch. The foreskin has numerous protective, immunological, sensory, and sexual functions. The foreskin is noted for its friction-reducing gliding action.\nA tight foreskin (phimosis) is defined as the inability to retract the foreskin fully. If retraction when flaccid is possible, it is termed partial phimosis; if retraction isn't at all possible, it is termed full phimosis. Phimosis is caused by tightness of a part of the foreskin called the frenar band; or, a phimotic ring in this case.\nInfant boys are born with tight foreskins. Tight foreskins are normal in childhood and adolescence. A boy's foreskin should not be retracted until the boy can do it for himself.\nA related condition is frenulum breve - colloquially, a short banjo string. Here, the foreskin can be mobile, but cannot retract due to insufficient slack in the frenulum. Occasionally, this can lead to it tearing during intercourse. Further, it is entirely possible to have phimosis and frenulum breve; indeed, most men with full phimosis have a certain element of frenulum brevity.\nIs it a problem?\nQuite simply, if it's not causing you any problems, it isn't a problem and don't let anyone tell you it is. Many men with phimosis are perfectly happy with not being able to retract. If your concern is putting on a condom, although some instructions say to do so, it isn't necessary to retract the foreskin first.\nA note on paraphimosis\nIf the foreskin gets 'stuck' retracted behind the glans due to tightness of the frenar band/frenulum, the resulting state is known as paraphimosis. If this happens, don't panic. Give the glans a firm squeeze to shrink it whilst pulling the foreskin (and hence the frenar band) forwards over the glans. This usually fixes it - try applying some lubricant if it proves difficult (if you don't have any and get into this state, a bit of olive oil will do).\nIn the unlikely event that you can't fix it in this manner, go to A&E and they will sort it out - the first thing they try is the above procedure, so definitely do that first. It might sound dramatic to go to A&E, but if left in a paraphimotic state for serveral days, it can cause problems due to restricted blood flow.\nUsually the cause for phimosis and frenulum breve is just that the frenar band and frenulum are too tight; and indeed, as with an elastic band, stretching them can often sort it out. Sometimes foreskin tightness can also be caused by fungal infections, with symptoms including bleeding and cracked skin. In this case, go and show your GP to get something for it (often the same anti-fungal women use for thrush) as the infection needs treating first. Otherwise, the rest of this text assumes that tightness of the frenar band and/or frenulum is the problem.\nPhimosis and frenulum breve can be dealt with in four ways:\n2) Stretching with a Steroid Ointment (typically Diprosone)\n3) Minor surgery (preputioplasty or frenuloplasty)\nWhich of these you go for is entirely down to your preference. I'll go through them in this order.\nThe basic principle is to apply pressure to the frenar band, much as one would do to stretch an elastic band. I'll detail two exercises for phimosis, and one for frenulum breve. If you spend 5 minutes twice a day on stretching, that should be adequate. Once it's sorted, carry on for another 4 weeks afterwards to ensure it stays permanent.\nThe advantage of stretching is that you don't need to show your tackle to any medical professionals, and you can start doing it right now; okay, not right now if you're in an internet café or at work....\nPhimosis Exercise 1\nThis is appropriate if you cannot get two fingers into the foreskin at the end. If you can get two fingers in, skip to exercise 2 - it's more efficient.\ni) Attempt to retract the foreskin until there is some discomfort - as much as you can tolerate without being in agony.\nii) Hold for 30 seconds, then pull forwards again.\nRepeat this for 5 minutes. It can help to do it in the bath - the heat helps loosen things up a bit.\nPhimosis Exercise 2\nThis assumes you can get two fingers in - if not",
      "Safety Tips: Swimming and Diving\nSwimming and diving are fun, but swimming a lot can lead to repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) (also called overuse injuries) and diving injuries can be serious.\nTo keep things as safe as possible for swimming and diving season, follow these tips.\nWhy Are Swimming and Diving Safety Important?\nDepending on the stroke, overuse injuries are common in swimming. Swimmers who do a lot of freestyle, butterfly, or backstroke can get “swimmer’s shoulder.” Swimmer’s shoulder affects the tendons of the rotator cuff, the group of muscles that support the shoulder. Knee and hip injuries are more common with breaststroke kicking, while butterfly kicking can lead to lower back problems.\nIf you’re a diver, hitting the diving board can leave you with scrapes, cuts, bruises, and broken bones. Hitting your head on a diving board or the bottom of the pool can cause a head injury, permanent spinal cord damage, paralysis, and even death. And if you are knocked out in the pool, you could possibly drown.\nYou’ll need a pool and your team’s swimsuit, obviously, but here are few other things to think about:\n- Goggles. Swimming with leaky, uncomfortable, or foggy goggles can be tough on your eyes. Be sure to get a pair of competition or practice goggles that are comfortable and fit your face. Some swimmers like to have different goggles for practices and competitions.\n- Swimsuits. Choose a swimsuit based on what’s most important to you. If you want something that will help you go faster, research brand names and see if they can back up the claims they make. If you want a suit for practice, choose something made with quality materials that will last awhile.\n- Swim caps. Most swim caps are made from latex or silicone. As with swimsuits, choose a cap based on your needs. In general, latex caps are thinner and less expensive, and silicone caps are usually thicker, last longer, and cost more. If you’ll be spending a lot of time in a warm pool, a silicone cap might keep your head too warm.\n- Ear plugs and nose clips. Some swimmers like to use these to help keep water out of their ears and noses. Ear plugs should be specifically designed for use in the water. (Noise-canceling earplugs won’t make a watertight seal.) Nose clips should fit comfortably and stay securely in place as you swim.\nBefore You Hit the Pool\nGetting yourself in shape before the swimming season starts will help you be a better swimmer or diver and make injuries less likely to happen. Start working out and eating right a few months before the season begins. Better yet, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet year-round, and then you won’t need to worry about being in shape for the season.\nIf you like to cross-train in the preseason, include exercises that help strengthen the muscles of your back and abdomen. A strong core and related muscles can help prevent the imbalances that can lead to overuse injuries.\nIf you’ll be doing more swimming than you’re used to due to increased practice time, or if you’re going to start swimming longer distances, build up to the extra time or distance gradually. Studies show that increasing the time or distance all at once can make injuries more likely.\nWhile You Swim or Dive\nAlways use good stroke technique when you swim. This will reduce the stress on your joints that can lead to overuse injuries. If you get tired or have pain at practice, stop swimming and get out of the pool. Swimming when you’re tired or have pain can make you use poor swimming technique.\nTo help keep your goggles on during a racing start, tuck your chin to your chest before you hit the water.\nWhen diving, be sure to the pool is deep enough and jump well away from the board and stay clear of pool walls to avoid head injuries.\nA Few Other Reminders\n- If you feel pain in your shoulder or elsewhere, take time off from training that causes pain. This can mean swimming a different stroke or doing something else out of the pool to stay in shape. You can go back to your regular stroke after the pain is gone.\n- To help prevent swimmer’s ear — an infection of the ear canal — dry your ears thoroughly with a clean towel after swimming or showering. Consider using water drying ear drops after you’ve finished swimming for the day. (But don’t use these drops if you have ear tubes or a hole in your eardrum.)\n- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after practices and matches.\n- For outdoor practices and meets, wear water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Reapply the sunscreen every 1 to 2 hours. If you’re not sure you’re putting on enough, switch to sunscreen with a higher SPF, like SPF 30.\n- If another swimmer does something you disagree with, don’t",

Clarke and Frank L. Parker, Vanderbilt University INTRODUCTION Recovery of uranium using conventional miningâopen pit and under- groundâto excavate the ore and chemical processing to extract the uranium from the ore generates large volumes of solid and liquid material (uranium mill tailings, or UMT). These wastes are typically collected and stored in ponds, al- though there has been some effort to replace them in the excavated areas. If left uncovered, UMT constituents can be released to the atmosphere and transported to surface waters and groundwater through erosion and leaching, respectively. Remediation-reclamation approaches either keep the tailings covered with water, leave the dewatered tailings in the ponds or piles, or place them in prepared near- surface or surface pits with drainage and covers to reduce the erosion, resuspen- sion, and leaching of the tailings. Until the mid-1970s, uranium was recovered exclusively through conven- tional mining approaches (underground mines and open-pit mining) in the United States. The first commercial application of in situ recovery and in situ leach (ISL) techniques that used chemical agents to extract the uranium through an array of injection and recovery wells was in 1975. Use of this technology increased as it gained a cost advantage, and now most uranium in the United States is recovered using ISL. In situ approaches have the advantage of eliminating large volumes 69\n70 CLEANING UP SITES CONTAMINATED WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS of tailings. However, it is typically impossible to restore groundwater quality to its initial state when uranium recovery is done in situ or to totally contain all of the leachate material (Davis and Curtis, 2007). However, most uranium mining wastes in the United States have come from conventional mining operations, both surface and underground, from 1957 to 1989 (World Nuclear Association, 2007). URANIUM RECOVERY AND MILL TAILINGS IN RUSSIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION Uranium recovery in Russia and the former Soviet Union is done through both ISL and conventional mining. In the early 1990s, approximately 38 percent of uranium mined in the former Soviet Union came from ISL (Bradley, 1997). For the Russian Federation, on the basis of metric tons of uranium in the concentrate, the distribution of the 3,281 metric tons of uranium obtained from conventional mining and ISL in 2004 was as follows (OECD-IAEA, 2005): â¢ Open-pit and underground mining: 2,880 metric tons â¢ ISL: 200 metric tons â¢ Heap leaching: approximately 190 metric tons â¢ In-place leaching (slope or block): 11 metric tons During the workshop, it was stated that Russia intends to increase its produc- tion of uranium from 4,900 metric tons in 2010 to 18,000 metric tons by 2020 (Shatalov, 2007). Conventional mining of uranium has left large areas (several square kilometers) of land contaminated with mill tailings. For example, Uzbeki- stan has 2.8 km2 of such land; Tajikistan, 3 km2; Kyrgyzstan, 6.5 km2; Kazakh- stan, 2.5 km2; and Russia, 2 km2 (Karamushka and Ostroborodov, 2008). As of 1990 the former Soviet Union had generated approximately 5 billion metric tons of mill tailings (Bradley, 1997). THE WISMUT SITE IN FORMER EAST GERMANY The major source of uranium for the Soviet Union was the mines, collec- tively now known as Wismut, in Saxony and Thuringia in the German Demo- cratic Republic (GDR). More than 400,000 people have worked at Wismut, with peak employment reaching 130,000 people in 1950. The total output of the mines was 231,000 metric tons, with peak production of 7,100 metric tons in 1967. During the Cold War, very little was known about uranium mining in the Soviet Union",
      "There's no denying that curly strands need all the love that they can get. From wavy hair to curly and coily hair, being able to give your mane the right amount of hydration can make or break your look. And to lock down the best hair care products for your strands, learning about your unique hair texture is the key to success. Not too sure how to identify your naturally curly texture? Lucky for you, we're here to assist! Follow along as we share everything you need to know about different hair textures, so you can find yours and learn how to create the perfect hair care routine.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE TEXTURED HAIR?\nFirst things first, maybe you aren’t sure if you have textured hair. While everyone has a hair texture of some sort, textured hair refers to strands that have shape, especially tight or kinky curls. Textured hair is also often used synonymously with natural Black hair, although the two aren’t always the same. You can identify as having textured strands if your natural hair texture involves a curl pattern. Speaking of which…\nWHAT IS A CURL PATTERN?\nThink that a curl pattern refers to curls you create with heat styling tools or heatless curl techniques? Think again! Your curl pattern is all about the natural state of your hair after the wash process. Since your hair is free of dirt, oil, and product buildup, your true natural curl pattern can shine through.\nThere are three main natural textures: wavy, curly, and coily hair. If you're well versed in the natural hair world, you know to refer to these textures as Type 2 (wavy), Type 3 (curly), and Type 4 (coily). Additionally, there are also sub-types lettered A through C, which determines the difference between a loose or tight curl pattern.\nUNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT CURLY HAIR TEXTURES\nBelow, find a breakdown of each curl family.\nTYPE 2A: Do you notice that your hair flaunts a fine texture with a bit of a slight curl? If so, you're working with Type 2A hair. This curl type is much closer to a straight texture, making it easy to flaunt sleek strands or a slight tousled curl without the extra handiwork.\nTYPE 2B: Notice that your strands are pretty straight at the roots and form into waves toward the middle of your length? This is a clear indicator that you have Type 2B hair! From luscious waves to sleek hair, the possibilities are endless.\nTYPE 2C: Find yourself admiring your defined waves and ringlets? Chances are, you're working with Type 2C hair. This texture is much more coarse than other textures in the Type 2 family. Keep in mind, this means you'll have to put in more work with the help of hair styling products and heat tools if you want to achieve pin-straight strands.\nTYPE 3A: Do you often get compliments on your large, bouncy curls? Welcome to the world of Type 3A hair! This texture sports well-defined curls with a spiral or ringlet shape.\nTYPE 3B: If you have a mane full of Type 3B curls, your hair sports a springy and voluminous texture. A step up from Type 3A curls, your strands have a smaller width, which in turn give your mane a fuller appearance.\nTYPE 3C: Think your curls resemble tight corkscrews? Then, you're more than likely dealing with Type 3C hair. Featuring thicker strands with a tighter curl pattern, this hair type also amps up the volume to give you tons of body and movement.\nTYPE 4A: Known as the Type 4 texture that flaunts a more visible curl pattern, Type 4A hair features small and tight coils that resemble a zig-zag pattern. While other curl patterns may start mid-length, this coily texture begins at the scalp and continues through the ends.\nTYPE 4B: Unlike other curly textures that have a defined shape, Type 4B hair is in a class of its own. These strands have a 'Z' shaped pattern that tends to bend in sharp angles instead of curling.\nTYPE 4C: Last but certainly not least, we have Type 4C hair! Similar to Type 4B hair, this curl type offers a range of thin to coarse textures. Sporting a super-tight zig-zag pattern, these densely packed strands are often prone to major shrinkage with less definition.\nHOW DO YOU IDENTIFY YOUR HAIR TEXTURE?\nWondering what type of naturally curly hair you have? It's actually super easy to figure out. Like we noted above, the key to identifying your curl type is to pay attention to your strands. Of course, you'll want to make sure that your hair is chock full of moisture and nourishment, so give your strands a cleansing session with the help of the L’Oréal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo",
      "Your home is a special space meant for working, resting, and finding the comfort and peace you crave. To make your home truly sing, it’s worth taking the time to furnish your living room with area rugs that reflect your decor and lifestyle.\nRugs come in different sizes, materials, and styles. As a result, it can be daunting to pick your ideal area rug since you’d probably only want a rug that complements the furniture in your living room and best suits your home. If you’re on the hunt for a rug that will best suit your living room, you’re in luck—this guide is meant to help you know how to choose the best living room area rugs for your space. Read on for some of the best living room rug ideas worth stealing.\nWhat is the best rug for the living room?\nConsidering your living room is where you entertain friends and family, you likely want a rug made from high-quality materials. We recommend that you check the material your rug is made of before purchasing. Some rug materials may look beautiful and stylish, but they may be prone to staining and fading. There are so many options for choosing a living room rug that is not only stylish but durable. Wool or wool-blended area rugs are always a great choice, particularly for your living room, as they’re stain-resistant as well as resistant to fading. Their easy-care quality also makes them ideal for playrooms or pet places. Also, our Washable rugs are the ultimate in stress-free cleaning, as they can be put right in the washing machine!\nSynthetic rugs are a terrific fiber for the living room; made by powerlooming, they are extra-durable and stain resistant. They come in an incredible array of creative designs, too, from traditional Persians to contemporary geometric patterns.\nTwo kinds of rugs, because they’re more delicate than wool or synthetics, are used less often in the living room, but they can still be a great choice depending on your lifestyle. Sisal and jute rugs bring a beautiful, organic charm to your space because they are handmade from natural, renewable fibers; that also means that they are an eco-friendly choice. Jutes and sisals also make a great base layer if you’d like to layer a more durable and colorful wool or synthetic rug on top.\nThick shag rugs can look amazing in your living room, too—think of iconic Flokati or Moroccan styles, updated in today’s materials. Shags aren’t necessarily a great choice if you have high foot traffic that might cause a lot of wear and tear, but with a moderate amount of traffic and gentle care, shags can continue to look great for years.\nHow do I choose a rug for my living room?\nWhen choosing the most suitable rug for your living room, there are certain factors you need to take into account. Here are some things to look out for:\nConsider size and shape\nArea rugs come in a variety of sizes ranging from small, medium, large, and oversize. You need to be cautious so that you don’t pick one that is too small or too big, as it can throw off the visual balance of your living room. Instead, go for the size that best suits or matches the size of your living room. In the broadest terms, that means: the larger the living room, the larger the area rug.\nFor instance, an 8×10 rug is probably the standard and most common size for a medium-size living room. As a general rule of thumb, the front legs of your furniture should always fit comfortably on the rug.\nChoose your favorite rug shapes to complement the shape of your living room—from round and square rugs to rectangular-shaped rugs, your choice depends on the style statement you intend to show off.\nUnderstanding patterns and color\nPicking the right color and style of rug for your living room rug helps make a welcoming, homey space for yourself and visitors. Pick a rug palette that harmonizes with your living room—consider wall and furniture colors. The goal here should be to find a color that will not dominate with your living room, but will fit right in.\nBefore shopping, consider how you want your living room area rug to feel. With the rug texture in mind, you can also take note of the foot traffic. If you have a busy living room, you should opt for low-pile rigs in a contemporary or vintage palette that discreetly hide dirt, pet fur, and stains. High-pile or shag rugs and woolen or cotton rugs would also be a perfect fit for less busy areas.\nHow do you decorate a living room with a rug?\nWhen placing your living room rug on the floor, there are small things you can do to help create a feeling of harmony and unity. For example, if you have two couches, you should evenly position the rug between them, leaving an equal distance from the rug to the couches from both sides.\nSome people like to style their rugs differently depending on the season. In colder months you can try layering area rugs on top of each",
      "Woman 1: Hey!\nWoman 2: Hi! How was work?\nWoman 1: Ugh, exhausting, but fine. I think Gina finally admitted that we need to hire another person for the team, so that’s good. Let’s just hope it happens sooner rather than later. How was your day?\nWoman 2: Eh, it was okay. I got some writing done, but I’m still stuck on that one plot thing. What do you want for dinner?\nWoman 1: Mmmm, not sure. Not pizza, we ordered in for lunch.\nWoman 2: Is Alia doing something in the car?\nWoman 1: What?\nWoman 2: Alia, she didn’t follow you in.\nWoman 1: I thought you were picking her up.\nWoman 2: Um, no, you said you would this morning.\nWoman 1: YOU definitely said you were picking her up.\nWoman 2: No I didn’t! You did! I’m 100% sure.\nWoman 1: Okay let’s look at the transcript!\nWoman 2: How about we just pick up our daughter instead?\nWoman 1: SEE HERE IT SAYS…. oh …. shoot…\nMZ: Ugh. I have had this argument myself with my husband. C’mon man, you said you were going to figure out what’s for dinner. I don’t think so. That was yesterday. And sometimes I have to admit I’m not sure what day it is. Rose have you ever had this happen to you before?\nRE: Oh yes, I fight with all sorts of people about all sorts of things. And I’m always right, I would like to note. Bu t I wish I had a transcript to say so.\nMZ: It’s Note to Self, the tech show about being human. I’m Manoush Zomorodi. And this week, we are joined by Rose Eveleth. She’s the host of “Flash Forward,” great podcast about what it might be like to live in the future … and actually why the future is often way way closer than you think it might be. Today we’re going to talk about a future where every conversation is transcribed. Everything you say is written down. It is Searchable, it is recorded. And Rose, why would any ordinary person even want this?\nRE: Well first you could win arguments. That’s useful.\nMZ: Right. That we’ve established.\nRE: Yeah, you could capture funny things your kids say. Right? Like that’s a nice little thing. But there are other companies that are working on things like this speech recognition to be able to open up your phone, open your bank account as a biometric security thing, or if you’re at a doctor’s appointment and you have a conversation with your doctor and then afterwards instead of the doctor go and write down everything they said, it just autopopulates your medical records. So it seems like this sci-fi future that might never happen. And there are all these companies that are trying to develop speech recognition so basically you could unlock your phone with your voice, unlock your bank account with your voice, and as soon as they can solve the problems required to make that work, the next step to transcription is really really easy. All those problems that are solved for speech recognition would allow us to have this future.\nMZ: I mean in some ways, the future is already here in that Siri is listening for instructions and Amazon’s Echo thing that you know, you can say out loud Alexa turn on Radiolab and it will start playing it. So they are listening all the time in some ways. So that means there’s privacy implications there. And that it’s a very small step from listening all the time to recording, transcribing, and keeping.\nMZ: So we actually did test out if someone’s life was taped and put on the record. And some intense things occurred. Some very boring things -\nRE: A lot of boring things.\nMZ: But also a crazy moment, which we’re gonna get to in just a little bit. But for now we are ready to go back to the future with you, Rose.\nRE: We start in California with someone who is already using speech to text systems in her daily life, all the time.\nHR: My name is Heather Ratcliff and I work in the cannabis industry but more importantly I’m disabled, I have a disease called Ehlers-Danlos disease which is a collagen disorder and it causes my joints to dislocate really easily, so I end up using voice to text really often because my fingers will dislocate.\nRE: And it’s super painful when her fingers dislocate. So Heather uses speech to text in a couple of different ways. She’ll use it when her fingers or wrists have dislocated because she can’t type. But she also likes to tape interactions she has, to have a record of them.\nHR: I’ll do that pretty often if I’m going to the",
      "I discovered Charles de Lint books when I really needed to.\nA bookish lifeIt was 1995. I was an undergraduate uni student, studying librarianship and majoring in literary studies. I had never imagined going to university. No one in my family had been. I was shy and scared of people. I felt a sense of awe and terror that I was actually studying James Joyce and Chaucer\nStruggling financially to afford textbooks, living at home and travelling into the city each day to study books felt like a fanciful luxury. An income would have been preferable to help our household. I needed work to stay in uni, at a time when part-time jobs were hard to find in Adelaide.\nI had always dreamed of working in a bookshop. I could be brave in writing, so I wrote to all the bookshops in the city and told them how much I wanted to work there. I received lots of rejections.\nHowever, for one shop, the timing had been perfect. I met the bookshop owner and soon had my own set of keys to the shop in my first job! It was an hour on the bus which gave me plenty of time to read two novels a week. I had taken on an extra literature subject at uni so that I could study more genres.\nEvery minute of the day was about books!\nThe book shop I worked in itself wasn’t fancy. It had\nThe shop also had a few small shelves of full price novels.\nIt was at those shelves, in my first week there that Moonheart written in 1984 by Charles de Lint cast its spell. It fell onto the floor at my feet. Whilst this wasn’t unusual with our packed shelves, I still get an odd feeling when I think about that moment. As if this book actually wanted to be read. The cover art by David Bergen was undeniably part of the enchantment.\nFinding Charles de Lint\nThe funny thing about finding Charles de Lint was that in 1998, Charles de Lint was impossible to find in Adelaide in other bookshops. I know because I tried. We stocked them even though our fantasy section was incredibly small.\nI was allowed to read a little in the shop, if it was quiet. I think we sold more Charles de Lint books by having them noticed on the counter. The magic of those David Bergen covers. As I had so much other reading to do for my studies, this is how I read de Lint. In snatches of time, in the in-between places. Late night buses home.\nIt may have been the cover that grabbed me, but it was Charles de Lint’s writing that owned me.\nThe mythical and magical woods\nAfter that one book, Charles de Lint catapulted to be being my favourite author. I read Greenmantle, SpiritWalk, The Little Country, everything, until we ran out of de Lint paperbacks. De Lint stories taught me something that changed the way I looked at the world. I found a way to celebrate always feeling like a misfit at a time when I was in a place where I felt that I didn’t really belong.\nCharles de Lint’s urban fantasy stories are rich with relatable folk musicians, bikers, creative thinkers, fringe dwellers, down to earth and relatable female characters and wild gods that walk in urban neighbourhoods. They are true-hearted everyday dreamers and artists. Urban places in countries far away are linked to the magical mythologies of others. In Moonheart, that began with modern downtown Ottawa to the wild mythology of Wales.\nThe sound of reading\nCharles de Lint also included references to celtic folk music, a love that spawned in my 20s. Characters tapped their toes to real bands like Silly Wizard in the text. In the Author’s notes he cited other musical influences the book was written along to.\nThose stories helped me see the magic in everyday little things, wherever I was. They also helped me overcome my shyness. At the time, I learned to value the interesting wanderers who would come into the shop on Sunday afternoons especially. Those who wanted small talk with their books.\nNewford and Tamson House\nA series of Charles de Lint books is known as The Newford series. They are all set in a fictional version of Ottawa which straddles the Otherworld, with characters that return throughout the series.\nNewford, although fictional became part of my inner cache of imaginary geography. Tamson House, an immense artist share-house with three towers and a “sense of Gothic” still feels like a real place years after reading these books. I would love to wander in the four acre wild garden in the middle, filled with fruit trees, ivy, birch and oak trees and vegetable beds accessed by cobblestone paths.\nI’m wasn’t alone in my enchantment with Tamson House. 1998 was the dawn of the graphical web. I found other fans running a",
      "Repaircare are a National appliance repair company offering fixed price repairs. This review was written only several months after they began trading. Things may, or may not, be different now.\nTheir fixed price appliance repairs include call out, parts, labour and VAT. Repaircare are part of Connect Distribution who are the UK’s largest distributor of appliance spares and accessories.\nThey supply much of the independent repair trade. Their website is easy to use and features 3 simple steps to get a quote. It’s incredibly simple and well designed.\nHow do they do fixed repairs? What’s the Catch?\nI’m naturally pretty sceptical and not easily impressed – always looking out for a catch. It shouldn’t be possible for Repaircare to be able to include the spare parts in their repair charges but they are the UK’s largest spare parts distributor so they have access to much cheaper parts than most and they obviously think they can.\nRepaircare advertised fixed price repairs, but unfortunately the truth is they did not fix every appliance for the price initially quoted. They covered themselves against the more expensive repairs with a clause in their terms and conditions allowing them to charge extra.\nThey did claim that most repairs should be covered by the amount advertised, but after a few months (of complaints) they were forced to change their terms and conditions to remove their right to charge extra for certain parts. Offering fixed price repairs is a big ask.\nBut Repaircare should have access to very cheap spare parts because of their massive buying power as part of the UK’s largest spares distributor 4Ourhouse. However, they don’t employ their own engineers.\nThey instead use a network of independent engineers, which appears to cause some problems at times where people have complained of poor customer service.\nRepaircare have been accused of washing their hands of some complaints when (presumably) a customer and the independent engineer have been telling them different things.\nHowever, I don’t believe they can do this because a customer’s contract is with Repaircare, and not the engineer that Repaircare subcontracted to do the repair.\nIt sounds like Repaircare have been frustrated by different accounts from the engineer and customer and want them to sort it out between themselves. But if a customer can’t, then Repaircare must.\nMargins must be small and this operation probably relies on economies of scale. As it is covering all of the UK they may be able to achieve the quantities of repairs necessary to be viable. However, they need most repairs to be relatively minor to balance out the expensive repairs.\nIf only people suspecting they have a serious fault use them, the system just won’t work. There have been a lot of complaints in the comments of this article (and elsewhere), which is disappointing.\nThey may have been struggling to cope with the work load at the early stages as they had promoted themselves very heavily. It’s also fair to say that appliance repairs tend to attract a lot of dissatisfied customers due to the length of time it can sometimes take to get them repaired.\nRepaircare did eventually respond pro-actively to public complaints and put in place a system to allow people to complain directly to a manager. People with complaints previously felt they had no option but to complain on the Internet because they couldn’t get past the call centre staff to complain to a manager.\nIf you are the type of person who takes comfort in prices being fixed and inclusive, then fixed price repairs may be attractive for you. Sadly it’s become the main way large repair companies operate now.\nYou can end up paying a lot more than necessary if your appliance turns out not to need any parts, or only needs inexpensive parts, (most repairs).\nYou can save money if it needs an expensive part but if it’s quite expensive most repair companies just tell you it’s beyond economical repair. This can make it difficult to get a “win” on these schemes.\nMake sure you read and understand the terms & conditions. It will probably state that if parts are “too” expensive they can say the appliance is not worth repairing, which may still cost you a fair amount of money.\nMake sure you understand how much it will cost you in that scenario.\nSome manufacturers also offer fixed price repairs now at rates competing with Repaircare. For example Hoover / Candy, Ariston, Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda and even the obsolete Dyson washing machine have fixed price repairs. Also, AEG, Electrolux and Zanussi have relatively low and reasonable labour charges.\nOnly 3 months guarantee\nA mere 3 months guarantee on repairs is very poor indeed. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (previously the Sale of Goods Act), any repair should last a reasonable time, as should any new parts fitted. 3 months (90 days) is nowhere near a reasonable time for almost any repair, especially if new parts are fitted. However, that’s all you get.\nSo you would have to pursue your claim in the small claims court or through a consumer help body if a repair by a company offering only 3 months guarantee failed after an unreasonable time outside",

      "If you are reading this, chances are you and/or your child are interested in being creative through drawing. Humans have engaged with the practice of mark-making for a recorded 60,000 years plus. It’s a natural, valuable yet sometimes underrated process. From the pre-historic cave paintings to the more current adaptation of digital technologies; using lines and shapes to create form still remains as one of the most intuitive and sophisticated ways for humans to communicate ideas. Comparing a toddler’s random scribbles to ancient Gwion Gwion (Bradshaw) cave paintings and more ‘modern’ Da Vinci style masterpieces… each drawing brings with it its own unique qualities, purpose and intention. Whether for fun, story-telling, careful observation or perhaps therapy; the purpose and act of drawing has its own benefits…of which are a separate thesis ‘or two’ in themselves. With a little thought and organisation, encouraging your child to express themselves through drawing at home (no matter how simple or complex) is not only achievable but can bring enormous rewards to you and your child.\nHere are 5 practice tips for encouraging your child to draw:\nCreate an inviting space.:\nFinding a quiet ‘nook’ or surface in your home has benefits in many ways. It allows your child a calm area to default to when feeling overwhelmed and can give them a sense of belonging within your home. Simplicity is the key. A small bench or table works well and if you have something transportable ‘moving’ outside on a sunny day can spark interest and enthusiasm. Allow your child to decorate their space with a few objects or images they love. Hang fairy lights or pick autumn leaves from outside as inspiration. Importantly, allow the space to evolve as your child’s interests do.\nCreative spaces can be so much fun to design. Image from The Imagination Tree and The Art Pantry.\nDrawing Materials: There is a huge variety of materials on the market but it doesn’t need to be complicated. Having a basic supply of good quality materials accessible to your child will help them to feel successful with their drawing. Be selective with the items you put out and allow your child to explore the medium wholeheartedly. Explore drawing on different types of paper, cardboard, and boxes. Try oil pastels on baking paper, painting with Q-tips on alfoil, glide a stick through sand or polenta in a tray. With preschool and older children, have materials easily accessible. This will encourage them to work independently and (hopefully) help them with the process of packing up! Buy or make a sketchbook to travel with.\nYou can also source some great art materials here:\nLove this idea from Creative Work-space with Ikea Trolleys.\nIdeas and Inspiration: Children will naturally make marks using tools from a very early age. Most will draw from their imaginations while they make sense of the world and develop their fine motor skills. Inspiration will vary for each child and may come from a favorite toy, or book they have read, a shape they are mastering or perhaps even a song they like. Collect, trace and observe shapes from nature or around the home. See if you can ‘break down’ objects into simple shapes and for reluctant drawers try adopting artist Paul Klee’s saying of “taking a line for a walk” to see where it leads. Play games like ‘Pictionary’ or ‘roll the dice’ to get things started. Visit a local gallery or for older children use the internet together to explore artists and images.\nImage from Imagination Tree\nLanguage and Feedback: Not all of us are natural born artists and like any skill set drawing is one that takes time to develop. With this in mind, resisting judgement around you and your child’s drawing can sometimes be challenging. Firstly, be kind to yourself and your own abilities. Practicing positive self-talk and ‘making mistakes’ in front of your child acknowledges the process of risk-taking and problem-solving that is part of the creative process. Allow your child time to point things out, perhaps help them to write words or a story to go with it. Ask them to describe their feelings when they were drawing the picture. Use statements or questions like: “ tell me about your picture” or “what is your favorite part?” Acknowledge all attempts of mark-marking, particularly with young children as they develop their fine motor-skills, explore new mediums and develop spatial awareness.\nChalk outside is the most amazing fun, great ideas from The Workspace for children.\nStorage of Finished (and un-finished ) works: Celebrate your child’s drawing! Displaying your child’s work will boost their confidence more than you know and the options are endless. Use coloured paper to back pictures, frames, pin up boards, hung string and empty walls/windows- all valuable spaces ready for a splash of life! Keep a scrapbook or shoebox of memorable pieces for the child to revisit and if you have space collate drawings using large plastic sleeves or envelopes. Not every drawing is going to be a masterpiece but you and your child will",
      "Even Bears, Martians And Robots Can't Perk Up The Dull Golden Globes\nIn recent years, the Golden Globes have been picking up steam as a less stuffy, less predictable awards show than most others. From the marvelous hosting of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for the past three years to glorious little moments like Emma Thompson tossing her shoes in the air, the Globes were starting to get a little bit of air under them — a fun diversion during awards season.\nIt was not to remain so. Sunday night, Ricky Gervais, who hosted the three ceremonies before the Fey/Poehler years, returned. What distinguished Gervais' previous appearances was the attempt to position him as a dangerous, rebellious, take-no-prisoners host — a tough sell when he was making jokes about things like Hugh Hefner being really old. But for the most part, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (which gives out these awards) has successfully sold the narrative of Gervais as fearless provocateur, and from the minute he stepped on stage Sunday, it was clear he was going to ride that horse as far as it would take him.\nHis early targets included Caitlyn Jenner (one joke about her car accident followed one that was basically just \"transgender people, right?\"), Jeffrey Tambor for playing a transgender woman, NBC for having no nominations (true, but there are far more daring things to say about network TV than that NBC didn't get nominated for any Golden Globes), and the Globes themselves, which he ribbed with a tamer version of a joke he made years ago about how the awards are all bought and paid for. It's a joke that doesn't feel particularly daring since he's basically already made it and been invited back. They clearly don't mind and he's already said the same thing years ago, so where's the risk?\nUnfortunately, Gervais' weak monologue was followed by a weird appearance by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, who — OK, look. The whole reputation of the Globes is that everybody is bombed the entire time. Either bombed in practice or in spirit — that's part of the charm. And I would never comment on who is bombed and who is not as a matter of science, but I can say that Hill, wearing a bear head, threw himself into the bombed feelingof the ceremony in the \"some drunk people are hostile and nonsensical\" fashion rather than the more enjoyable \"some drunk people burble delightfully with enthusiasm\" fashion. Whether he was actually bombed or not, you see.\nThe bear bit was also the beginning of a recurring problem over the course of the evening: at some point, people seemed to forget entirely that they were on network television, and they swore so gratuitously that big chunks of things said on stage were silenced by the censor button, rendering certain appearances rather difficult to interpret. Swearing isn't necessarily bad in and of itself, but the way it leaves giant gaps in the audio doesn't make for a very good show at home.\nOne of the most striking things about the evening was that the low points brought out the ability of some of the presenters to instantly lift audience spirits. Andy Samberg, who hosted the Emmys, has become a reliably lovely and funny presence at events like this, and America Ferrera and Eva Longoria did a really funny bit about being confused with other Latina actresses: \"Hi, I'm Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes.\" \"And hi, I'm America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguez.\" (Ferrera and Rodriguez actually were mistaken for each other by the Globes themselves during the nominations. Mentioning that? That's a little daring.) It ended with the women addressing each other as \"Salma\" and \"Charo.\" Funny!\nAt times, though, these awards just seemed a little snakebit, having trouble getting joy where joy should have been easy: What should have been a great moment for Sylvester Stallone (who won a supporting award for Creed) was marred by his forgetting to thank writer-director Ryan Coogler or anyone in the cast, which he reportedly ran back on stage to correct, but after the TV coverage had already cut away. Aziz Ansari had a very funny bit where he was in the audience reading How to Lose to Jeffrey Tambor with Dignity when the lead TV comedy actors were announced, but his joke fell victim to the unexpected victory of Gael Garcia Bernal for Mozart in the Jungle — a very low-profile Amazon show that was also named the best TV comedy.\nOf course, the advantage that awards shows have is that when you put enough charismatic, enjoyable people on stage, you'll get good moments. Rachel Bloom of the CW's Crazy Ex-Girlfriendwas an excited delight as the winning TV comic actress, Oscar Isaac was charming accepting an award for the HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero, Taraji P. Henson was luminous accepting for Empire, and Tom Hanks made a predictably fine presenter of",
      "Lookinf doe Does Ancheer Treadmill Incline?…The Ancheer is actually excellent value if you’re keen to buy your first e-bike. It’s constructed to a cost, thus do not assume high quality elements. It is actually just as powerful as much more expensive electricity bikes as well as the battery has adequate electrical power for a 30-mile trip so long as it’s a warm and comfortable day and also not very hilly.\nIs Ancheer a good brand?\nOut on the road, I was actually nicely startled. The sleek 250w geared back hub motor is actually undoubtedly powerful sufficient to assist acquire you up those mountains! The cadence -based pedal assist is quite basic and operates much like an on/off switch. When you begin pedalling the electric motor provides immediate electrical power. Yet another wonderful attribute with this bike is that it may be pedalled conveniently along with the power switched off.\nAs I have formerly discussed, I discovered this bike a little bit of as well tiny for me, yet the seat really felt pleasant sufficient for briefer quests.\nThe control panel carries out not possess an LCD show, but at this cost it shouldn’t be a problem. There are actually 3 methods to pick from– low, higher and mid. These electrical power modes are changed using the + and– keys on the keyboard, with the on/off key between. There is actually additionally a five-bar LED electric battery indication.\nFew electrical bikes yet have their electric batteries and also circuitry concealed inside the framework, however although the Ancheer isn’t the sleekest along with all its wires on display screen, the completely removable electric battery implies you can uncover it along with the key as well as take it indoors to demand (which takes 4-6 hrs).\nThe bike happens to some extent taken apart for freight, so you’ll have to fasten the handlebars, pedals, main illumination, quick-release saddle and also front tire. In each, it’ll take you around 30 minutes consisting of getting rid of all the cord associations and also packaging. The devices to accomplish this are actually consisted of, but you could like you use your own screwdriver and also as the provided tools are poor premium.\nWhat is the best electric bicycle? Does Ancheer Treadmill Incline\nNote that unlike the seat, the face and also back tires are actually certainly not quick release: they need a 15mm monkey wrench.\nOn the left side of the handlebars is actually an essential control panel with keys for power and increasing or even lessening the help degree. LEDs illuminate for low, medium as well as high amounts, and there is actually a battery gauge also. Below this is actually a button for the frontal light and also a horn switch.\nIf you desire a sheer electricity mode where you can power the bike without pedalling, in the carton you’ll discover a twist-grip throttle which you’ll have to install on your own. This isn’t legal to utilize when driving in the UK or even Europe which is why it is actually certainly not set up by the manufacturing facility.\nBut you may utilize it off roadway, and right it takes about 15 mins. The directions remain in pretty poor English as well as it is actually very easy to skip the part which reveals that you have to press the ‘-‘ switch on the control board till all the help illuminations have gone out. Only after that will definitely the throttle work.\nTo fit it, a briefer handlebar hold is actually provided as well as you’ll have to loosen the electric battery placing plate from the down tube and also the black box of cords which hangs behind the seat post. And also if you fancy a little additional rate, you can disconnect the white colored cord which confines the motor to the EU-regulated 15.5 mph. This gives you a few added miles per hour that’ll allow you travel at a relaxed 20mph.\nIn relations to specifications, the 250W motor is the absolute most strong you can easily have under present law and also it is actually powered by a 36V 8AH battery. This is enough for 15-30 miles depending upon the temperature level, wind disorders and also surface.\nThe bike itself has entry-level Shimano gears (21-speed) along with three chainrings at the front end and also seven sprockets at the rear. This is in contrast with various other designs our team have actually viewed which possess only one chainring and additional gears at the rear end. The Ancheer’s tailoring is actually likewise fairly low, so it isn’t really achievable to go much faster than 20-25mph.\nYou get disk brakes, both face as well as rear. They are actually mechanical instead of gas, yet they still do a nice project of delivering you promptly to a stop.\nThe main surprise is actually unbranded and also isn’t adjustable. It’s relatively challenging, however that’s more suitable provided",

      "Conference calls a waste of time? In 1915, this one made history\nBy Stephen Lawson\nThese days, making a call across the U.S. is so easy that people often don’t even know they’re talking coast to coast. But 100 years ago Sunday, it took a hackathon, a new technology and an international exposition to make it happen.\nThe first commercial transcontinental phone line opened on Jan. 25, 1915, with a call from New York to the site of San Francisco’s Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Alexander Graham Bell made the call to his assistant, Thomas Watson. Just 39 years earlier, Bell had talked to Watson on the first ever phone call, in Boston, just after Bell had patented the telephone.\nBy 1915, the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. network spanned the continent with a single copper circuit 6,800 miles (11,000 kilometers) long that could carry exactly one call at a time. There were already 8.6 million phones served by AT&T, but hearing someone’s voice from the other side of the continent was astounding, like being able to go to the moon, said Anthea Hartig, executive director of the California Historical Society.\nIt was a fitting event leading up to the exposition, which celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal and the latest technological and cultural achievements of the day. Like other big fairs of the day, it was also a theme park of popular attractions and opulent architecture, and it drew almost 19 million visitors.\nWhere Bell and Watson’s first call in 1876 had been a private experiment, their talk across the country in 1915 was a major public event. It represented a huge technological achievement that had been set into motion seven years earlier. In 1909, AT&T president Theodore Vail had pledged to start transcontinental phone service in time for the opening of the exposition—without knowing how to do it.\nAt the time, the phone network reached only as far west as Denver. Between that point and the phones on the West Coast lay much of the Rockies, the vast deserts of Utah and Nevada, and the Sierra Nevada. Crews had to install poles and string wires across the whole region using horse-drawn wagons and early automobiles. In winter, they would face 20-foot snow drifts in the Sierra.\nBut new technology was needed, too.\n“The biggest challenge was amplifying sound so it could be transported 3,400 miles,” said AT&T Archivist Bill Caughlin. That called for more powerful amplifiers all along the line from New York to San Francisco.\nEngineers throughout AT&T competed to solve the problem, just as developers often take each other on at hackathons today. And just as it often happens in Silicon Valley, it was a consultant—inventor and radio pioneer Lee De Forest—who contributed the key idea. His three-element vacuum tube formed the basis of the carrier’s new amplifiers, used first for the transcontinental line and later for all of AT&T’s repeaters for years to come.\nIn addition to cutting-edge electronics, there were more down-to-earth concerns. AT&T employees had so much ground to cover that they developed a new kind of machine so they could dig holes for telephone poles faster.\nBy June 1914, the more than 730,000 pounds (331,000 kilograms) of copper had been strung out across the network and engineers started making test calls. But commercial service didn’t begin until after the Jan. 25, 1915, ceremonial call. When it did, a three-minute call cost $20.70, the equivalent of nearly $485 today.\nIf they’d been paying, the participants on that first call would have racked up quite a bill. After Bell and Watson talked, a string of dignitaries including the mayors of San Francisco and New York went on the line. Vail called in from his summer home in Jekyll Island, Georgia, where a special private line had been set up because an injured leg prevented him from going to headquarters in New York. Then U.S. President Woodrow Wilson came on the line from the White House.\nIt took about 10 minutes just to connect a transcontinental call, because the connection had to be set up step by step with a switchboard operator in each city along the way. The ceremonial call on Jan. 25 took three and a half hours, from 4:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. New York time. Then Boston joined in for more conversations—even one in Cantonese, between the founder of a Chinese telephone exchange in San Francisco and a Southern Pacific Railroad official in Boston.\nLater that evening, the line was opened to paying customers. The first call was made by Fred Thompson, at the Stewart",
      "by ADAM J. HANSEN\nThroughout the history of the American fire service, many tools in its “toolbox” have been invented and created by its very own members, which makes perfect sense. In all aspects of life, the idea for an invention comes when a task may not be going as planned and someone may think, “There has to be an easier way of doing this” or “If we only had a better tool.” It’s at those moments when the tools of our trade are created. This moment of clarity happened to my fellow member, Milford (CT) Fire Department (MFD) Lieutenant Mike Donegan, who not only thought of a new idea for a tool but was also driven to build it.\nDonegan has been dedicated to the fire service for nearly 20 years. Throughout those years, he has continuously attempted to devise new ideas to help our department move forward. However, his “Frame Spreader” is his one contribution that I feel compelled to share with other firefighters (and not just the 125 MFD members) (photo 1).\n|(1) The Frame Spreader. (Photos by Mike Donegan.)|\nOf the countless calls to which we respond each year, the majority are not working structure fires; they are medical calls, fire alarms, utility hazards, and other routine type emergencies. When we attempt to enter structures, sizing up the severity of the call is a must. In other words, if we pull up and find smoke showing, all bets are off – damaging the door and the frame is now the least of our worries. However, if we pull up to a one-story, wood-frame, single-family dwelling with nothing visible from the exterior and an audible alarm sounding, our sense of urgency immediately decreases. If you cannot make entry through an unlocked window or some other opening, then through-the-lock forcible entry is often the next least destructive method of gaining entry. Or is it?\nWhile responding to these routine entry calls, Donegan began to think of a way to do the least amount of damage possible while still delivering quality customer service. He had an extensive background in carpentry. With this heightened awareness of home repairs, he became tired of going to these routine type calls and causing unnecessary damage.\nDesign and Construction\nThe Frame Spreader’s design is married to that of a hydraulic ram (photo 2), which has become a tremendously popular, common tool in fire departments around the world. The Frame Spreader is constructed of three-inch square steel tubing. Its interior opening measures 2¼ inches wide (photo 3); this size opening facilitates the clearance of the cylindrical-shaped base of the hydraulic ram. Once the cylinder base clears the inside opening, the Frame Spreader comes to rest against the square-shaped main body of the hydraulic ram. These dimensions allow for an extremely solid contact point that does not allow any excessive movement of either tool.\n|(2) The Frame Spreader and hydraulic ram joined together.|\nThe base of the Frame Spreader features a square heel plate made of steel. The heel plate allows for a solid contact point that rests against the door jamb, and its square shape helps distribute the pressure of the overall operation. This increased surface area prevents damage that would otherwise be produced if a smaller contact point had been used.\n|(3) Interior view of the Frame Spreader.|\nThe Frame Spreader is 16 inches long from the base plate to the hydraulic ram contact point. This length allows the tool to be used with doors that are 30, 32 (photo 4), and even 36 inches wide. Although you do not need a four- × four-inch chock to obtain capture when forcing 30-inch doors, it is recommended that you use a two- × four-inch piece of cribbing (if it is available) or other suitable material that will increase the surface area against the opposite door jamb. Otherwise, the homeowner will have a “rabbit ears” indentation left in his door jamb. When attempting to spread doors that are 32 or 36 inches wide, you will need a four- × four-inch piece of wood or synthetic cribbing to create capture. Since this tool is meant to leave behind the least amount of damage possible, take the time to place a small piece of cribbing between the opposite jamb and the head of the hydraulic ram.\n|(4-6) The Frame Spreader and the hydraulic ram set in a 32-inch door with a four- × four-inch piece of cribbing.|\nUsing the Frame Spreader\nUsed properly, the Frame Spreader will spread the door frame just enough to allow for the latch to clear from the strike plate. To carry out the actual frame spread, two firefighters are needed (mostly because the unit’s steel construction makes it quite heavy when it is in place). Next, place the cylindrical base of the hydraulic ram into the opening of the Frame Spreader until the base of the hydraulic ram comes to rest on the edge of the Frame Spreader.",
      "Throughout the Bible, there are countless stories of ordinary people whole-heartedly attempting to live a life fully surrendered to God's unique calling on their lives. More than once, God asks people of faith to relinquish control and simply trust Him. These days, singer/songwriter Laura Story is discovering the beauty found in letting go. It's this posture of surrender that she's striving for on her fifth studio album, Open Hands (Fair Trade Services).\n\"We have this picture all the way through the Scriptures of all these great leaders in this process of surrendering everything. What the Lord is asking them is not, 'You need to hold on tighter. You need to manage this better.' What the Lord asks us is to surrender,\" she offers, \"It's about learning to live with open hands, learning to live life in this constant state of saying, 'Lord, my life is Yours. My time is Yours. My resources are Yours. All of this is Yours. Do what You will.'\"\nStory has built a life--and a career--around submission to her calling. She's led worship at Atlanta's Perimeter Church for the past 12 years. In addition to penning songs recorded by artists like Chris Tomlin, Story has found success as a recording artist in her own right. Since the release of her solo debut in 2008, Story has amassed a GRAMMY® Award, a Billboard Music Award, multiple GMA Dove Awards and an RIAA Gold certification for her massive No. 1 hit \"Blessings.\" In addition, she's also the author of two books, including the latest \"When God Doesn't Fix It - Lessons You Never Wanted to Learn, Truths You Can't Live Without.\"\nOpen Hands is the follow-up to 2013's critically-acclaimed God of Every Story, and in the years that have passed since her last release, Story has given birth to twins, making their brood a family of five. Now, as a mom to three kids--Josie, Benjamin and Griffin--the posture of \"open hands\" feels more necessary than ever before as she juggles ministry and motherhood.\n\"We never get to a point where we can do life apart from complete and total daily dependence on Jesus,\" Story admits. \"The irony is the less control we have, the more peace we have and the more, I would even say, success and joy we find. It's a contrary picture to what the world tells us, but it's gaining through letting go.\"\nOpen Hands' fresh collection of originals blends Story's signature congregational worship with intimate moments. \"I wanted to make an album so that each song I write would be just that seed of hope or that lifeline that someone listens to during that tough moment and thinks, 'I'm going to choose to trust God, even during this,'\" Story shares. \"I pray that God would speak through me in the midst of the music.\"\nA parade of A-list songwriters, including Matt Redman, Matt Maher, Mia Fieldes, Hank Bentley, Sarah Hart and Seth Mosley, among others, pepper the album's 11 tracks. Through writing sessions both alone and with others, Story began to gradually see this common thread of surrender emerge.\n\"Rather than picking a theme and writing around it, a lot of times, it takes me writing to be able to step back and see what the themes are, not just of the record but of my life,\" she says of her creative process. \"It was neat to step back and see that 'open hands' is a theme that ended up presenting itself rather than me choosing it.\"\nThe title track--already a chart-topper prior to the album's release--features guest vocals from Third Day's Mac Powell, a fellow Atlanta-native and Story's longtime friend. \"You Came Running\" borrows imagery from the biblical narrative of the Prodigal Son. In true Story fashion, several selections (\"Awake My Soul (1000 Tongues),\" \"For The Love of My King\") reimagine timeless hymns, which she refreshes with an original chorus.\n\"I'm pretty sure that the theology that I learned as a kid was from old hymns. It's amazing, even now as an adult, how those hymns come back and really provide that sturdy foundation for life. It reminds me of how important it is for me to teach my kids those old hymns,\" Story reflects, adding, \"As long as I am singing, I will be singing hymns.\"\nPoignant piano ballad \"Give You Faith\" finds the singer pondering the legacy she wants to leave her children. \"The song is about releasing your kids into the hands of God,\" she explains. \"The most important thing that we could possibly give our children is to not just tell them about the faith that we have but to live out that faith as a family. Sometimes that means not giving them everything they want but showing them that the most important thing in my life isn't even them--it",
      "Israel’s Contemporary Achievements and Emerging Trends in Defence Research and Development\nAbstract: Israel inhabits an antagonistic strategic atmosphere and attracts chronic cycles of hostility within its region, slated to remain so through the immediate outlook. Israel’s considerable interest and investment in defence R&D has mobilized the growth of both civilian and defence segments as economic and security drivers of the country. R&D in defence has benefited the IDF, shaped linkages with previously other adversarial countries, and helped with the country's economic health by easing the burden of foreign exchange. Israel’s defence R&D also has had a psychological discovery wherein they showed their partners and rivals their capabilities, commitments, and abilities to ensure their national survival.\nBottom-line-up-front: Israel has managed to construct defence R&D competencies that not only are responsible for delivering solutions for its own unique national security requirements and concerns but has likewise proved beneficial to other countries around the world. Furthermore, innovation empowers Israel to reinforce its defence establishment while guaranteeing the IDF’s “qualitative” advantages.\nProblem statement: How does Israel work to uphold its dominance through excellent system design and assimilation expertise, engineering discoveries and the proficiency of operatives working on verge technologies, given its economic restrictions and limitations in human resources?\nSo what?: The capability to deter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from any single nation or likely coalition of countries, violent non-state actors as well as during hybrid warfare while minimizing damage and casualty requires military might be fortified by technologically superior armaments, weapons systems as well as C4I technological capabilities developed through defence R&D.\nWarfare is shaped and transformed by technological innovations and advancements. However, the demands of modern warfare also necessitate the cultivation of deterrence and detection capabilities which are then to be buoyed by dynamics and indigenous technological progress. Furthermore, enormous commercial applications of these technologies can be employed to advance the geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic objectives of a nation. Notably, the defence relation dividends are compounded for Israel by its position at the zenith of global innovation, especially in the research and development (R&D) in the defence sector. The feat is made impressive considering the size of the country along with its limited economic resources, human resources and dearth of natural resources.\nNotably, the defence relation dividends are compounded for Israel by its position at the zenith of global innovation, especially in the research and development (R&D) in the defence sector.\nAdditionally, the continued exacerbation of the security threats emanating from its geopolitical neighbourhood and other intensifying threat perceptions in the region primarily driven by regional armed conflicts, weapons embargoes, and boycotts have led to a persistent focus by Israel on defence R&D efforts. Hence, Israel has managed to construct defence R&D competencies that not only are responsible for delivering solutions for its own unique national security requirements and concerns but has likewise proved beneficial to other countries around the world such as its unmanned aerial systems, radars and electro-optical technology. Besides, innovation empowers Israel to reinforce its defence establishment while guaranteeing the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) “qualitative” advantages.\nThere are structural benefits that Israel has deliberately instituted in place as well, such as Israel’s Ministry of Defense (IMOD)'s Directorate of the Defense Research and Development (DDR&D), which has been active in the improvement and innovation of multiple defence-related technological leaps. Multiple innovative companies have also been started by elite combat units and Unit 8200 which have contributed to Israel earning the “start-up nation” moniker, including in the defence equipment and products domain. Furthermore, companies in Israel are paving the way to develop innovative equipment for the defence industry through a near-seamless concord between the defence and the civilian sector in defence R&D.\nThe capability to deter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from any single nation or likely coalition of countries, violent non-state actors as well as during hybrid warfare while minimizing damage and casualty requires military might be fortified by technologically superior armaments, weapons systems as well as C4I technological capabilities developed through defence R&D.\nGround-Based Air Defence\nOne of the technological achievements that Israel is known for is the Iron Dome which has been opined to be an innovative transportable missile defence system designed for defence against short-range rockets as well as UAVs. Its capabilities have been augmented to defend against several inbound threats concurrently. Development of the Iron Dome was initiated in 2007, and it was active in 2011. The United States collaborated with Israel to develop the system with Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) working on the R&D, Rafael functioning as the primary contractor along with the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).\nThe targeting system and radar are intended to aim its Tamir interceptors exclusively at inward bound projectiles that are a credible threat to strategic locations. It is not configured to target weapons headed for non-strategic areas. In the face of mounting challenges and rockets from Hamas and Hezbollah, the Israelis worked on the Iron Dome. Israel also advanced and developed a naval ship-based variety of Iron Dome, called the",
      "You might raise an eyebrow when you hear a midwife talking about geomapping instead of delivering babies during her christmas break. But didn’t I tell you this blog would cross all sorts of borders? If you would like to discover the actually pretty obvious link between geomapping and midwifery or you want to volunteer in humanitarian mapping, then this blog is for you.\nLet me take you to rural Tanzania, to the northern Serengeti district, not far from the famous Maasai Mara. Nomadic pastoralism and a farming lifestyle are common here. Every even-numbered year in December, the so called ‘cutting season’ starts, a cultural practice in which many young girls and women are subjected to female genital mutilation. This basically boils down to all sorts of procedures that lead to the “partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons” (WHO).\nObstetric and Health Risks\nGirls who undergo FGM run immediate health risks such as excessive bleeding, not seldom leading to death. They are vulnerable to all sorts of (chronic) infections, from wound infections, tetanus, gynaecological infections like STDs among which HIV, to cysts. Apart from psychological trauma, FGM can trouble normal body functions and lead to urinary, menstruation and sexual difficulties. Women who have been subjected to FGM also run a higher risk of all sorts of obstetric (sometimes life threatening) complications such as difficult and/or prolonged labour, obstetric tears or lacerations (fistula) and post-partum bleeding. These complications may lead to an increased prevalence of distressed babies, intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal death. Fighting FGM is important in reducing the maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rate, which is still pretty high in the countries involved.\nOutlawed but ongoing\nThere are around 30 countries worldwide where FGM is concentrated, most of which are in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Besides, some immigrant communities in western countries practice FGM. Recently, UNICEF estimated that more than 125 million living girls and women have undergone FGM, while up to 30 million girls may be at risk if the current trend does not change. Tanzania is one of these countries. Even though it legally banned FGM in 1998, an estimated 15% of all girls and women between 15 and 49 years of age have undergone some form of FGM, almost always performed by a traditional practitioner. Incidence is highest among girls and women from rural and poor areas. Some hope, however, may be drawn from the fact that the girls in the youngest age group (15-19) are far less likely to have been cut than the women in the oldest groups. Something seems to be changing over generations. But as with most things, change takes time and community involvement. You at home can also play your part. Let me tell you how.\nOne way to combat FGM is by reaching out to communities and by going into dialogue with community leaders, parents and children. Educating them on the risks and long-term effects of FGM and informing girls at risk about ways to escape their tragic fate is key. For most parts of rural Tanzania however, maps are lacking, which makes it difficult for outreach workers to access and orientate in outskirt areas, and to reach the communities involved. Proper area maps which indicate roads and residential areas can help local NGOs (like Tanzania Development Trust) in their work and can help girls in finding a safe house (such as the one built in Mugumu). This way, maps can become an important tool in fighting FGM and this is exactly where you can come in.\nYou can help local NGOs worldwide to do their outreach work by joining the team of crowdmappers. All you need is a pc, a reliable internet connection, a bit of time and a few basic mapping skills you will easily obtain after going through the supplied instruction manual.\nIf you would like to map for Tanzania like I do, you first have to register as a United Nations Online Volunteer and enroll for the mapping project of Tanzania Development Trust. As soon as you have registered you will receive an email with all necessary information. They will ask you to open a free account at OpenStreetMap (OSM), a site for collaborative mapping. Then you are asked to go to the Task Manager for the Tanzania project which is hosted by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). To draw the maps, you will use the free online software, iD Editor. For this project on FGM in Tanzania, it basically suffices to trace highways and buildings and outline residential areas in the satellite images.\nThe idea behind HOT is to create and provide ‘Missing maps’. Missing Maps is a project that makes use of open source and open data and allows the crowd to collaborate in mapping for humanitarian organisations. Many vulnerable places in the world lack maps. When these areas are",

      "This is part of a series on design for user engagement (or addictive design) patterns, and good and bad examples of implementation of these patterns.\nToday’s is about digital products using “community” as a user engagement strategy.\n“Community”, The Feel Good Sauce ✨👨🏼🤝👨🏽👩🏻🤝👨🏽👭🏽\nLately, it feels like the word “community” is the secret, feel good sauce that promises to make every app, digital course, or even co-working space special.\nAnd it’s alluring. If you’re learning a new skill, hobby, or habit – chances are you’ll want people to talk to, buddy up with and ask questions.\nDedicated digital communities can be a product unto themselves, but today I’m looking at apps that include online communities as supplemental to the main offering.\nOnes that utilise the dopamine hit we get from upvotes, comments and likes to increase user engagement and retention.\nGood example of community as as a user retention feature\nShine describes itself as a self care app, with daily tips, mindfulness exercises, mood trackers and courses to help their users “live their best life”. Launched in 2018, they added community as a feature to their app in December last year (2019).\nWhat makes it work\nThe community feature is\n- strongly related to the content of the day (‘daily thought’ image & meditation)\n- The community question is primarily designed to reinforce of the message of the day through self reflection..\n- ..and to receive community support as a secondary, addictive, benefit.\nShine cleverly ties in our desire for “likes” with an activity that reinforces learning, which means the users are more likely to positively rate the app as being beneficial to them, thus upgrading to a paid plan, or continue subscribing.\nThe positive wording of the community post encourages people to say on topic in a positive or even vulnerable way. You’ll also notice there are no negative reaction options to shared community comments, and no ability to follow up with a snarky comment. There are only different positive reaction types, to give a sense of variable reward to those receiving feedback.\nIn short, Shine have done a great job of planning their content and community strategy and keeping the community aspect healthy.\nThis is a great implementation that adds value to their product, encourages positive behaviour changes and increases the likelihood of subscribers. 🤓👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\nThe Cons of Adding Community\nBecause the in-group dynamic is so addictive, established community users don’t want to hurt the feelings of another established community poster and risk being an outcast, even when the question posted is a huge red flag. This is the 8chan effect, where identification with the group as a whole becomes a bigger priority than any question or topic that might harm someone offline.\nI don’t want to name and shame specific apps, but I’ve seen some terrible implementations of community apps in the last months, particularly those aimed in the mental/physical health and wellness or pregnancy related audiences.\nIn all the bad cases I’ve seen, the community feature felt like it wasn’t thought out beyond being an inspirational buzzword on a pitch-deck. It seems like there was no resources available for dealing with real-life scenarios, like:\n– What happens when people prefer to ask the group questions that should be asked to drs because asking the group feels comforting while drs are scary?\n– What happens when the top advice posters on the group prefer to offer platitudes rather than tell someone to go to the ER because their baby hasn’t kicked for 24 hours? Advice which is easily findable on the NHS, or from any hospital, website.\n– in the above app for pregnant women to meet others like them locally, what ID or safety checks are available? Let’s take a moment to imagine the kind of user who has so few local contacts that this is their primary way of making friends (as I couldn’t help but wonder while using the app). It’s a vulnerable subset of users. No ID or verification was asked of me. The incidence of catfishing is probably pretty high in a ‘community’ like this.\nCommunity Neglect Hurts Product Uptake.\nThe communities above felt….trashy. I deleted the apps right away.\nEven though the people posting on the community tab and the people available locally to meet are almost certainly quite different demographically (US based for the message board, Madrid based for meet-ups), the kinds of posts I saw made me think I wouldn’t want to meet anyone from the app.\nIf your online community posters were in a room, would you want to go and hang out there for a few hours every week? If the answer is: no, then it’s not a selling point. It may even degrade from the overall app value.\nSecondly, allowing these kinds of conversation to take place isn’t freedom of expression; it puts people’s lives at stake in some cases.\nIt also lowers your brand.\nWhen google started to include “Expertise, Authoritat",

Premier League’s festive period schedules will see Tottenham playing three games in a span of eight days whereas Southampton face an even more daunting challenge of playing three games within six days. Southampton are unbeaten in their last four outings in all competitions and their net hasn’t been bulged at home in five hour and five minutes of Premier League football. The Saints are fresh off a magnificent 3-1 victory against their south coast rivals Bournemouth and will also draw inspiration from the fact that they are the last side to have won against Spurs at White Hart Lane.

The Spurs boss returns to his former workplace on Wednesday but it’s not his first visit to St.Mary’s as an opposing manager. Pochettino picked up four points from his past two visits to Southampton and will be looking to keep up his unbeaten run at St.Mary’s this Wednesday to keep Tottenham in contention for a top four berth.

      "In our 11 years as a guest ranch, we’ve never had a bigger celebration for Earth Day than we’ve had this week. This year we’ve found more ways to say thanks to nature, which has sustained us personally and professionally during the pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we had to revise our commitment to eliminate single-use plastics in a few small ways when it was necessary for safety protocols. Though we recommit to returning safely to single-use plastic elimination in all areas, we were inspired us to look deeper into our sustainability efforts to see where we could lessen our footprint further to minimize the environmental effects of new safety measures. Here’s a look at what we’ve been doing this week and this year to celebrate the Earth.\n1.Resuming our annual Clark Fork Cleanup\nIn 2015, we launched our first Clark Fork Cleanup along with the Clark Fork Coalition (who oversees cleanups throughout this watershed) and the Philipsburg Brewing Company. (Rock Creek is a tributary to the Clark Fork River.) The Cleanup continued for years.\nDue to high water levels and the pandemic, we were forced to go on a hiatus, but on Tuesday, April 20, we resumed the tradition with a total of 12 drift boats and rafts carrying 25 people! The Ranch provided lunch for the crew and removed approximately 1,500 lbs. of trash from 11 miles of the Clark Fork River. This included a kid’s bike, 30 pieces of sheet metal, three large rolls of wire fence and more.\n“The Clark Fork river has some of the best trout rivers in Montana flowing into the Clark Fork, yet I feel it’s one of the most polluted big rivers in Montana. When we get great partners Like Trout Unlimited, Clark Fork Coalition, along with local businesses like Philipsburg Brewery, to help us clean up for a day it can really make a difference! Over the years we’ve cleaned up almost 4 tons of garbage and metal out of the same 11 miles of river. You can see the change!” ~ Activities Director Patrick Little\n2. Adopting a stretch of highway\nThis year, our application to adopt four miles of highway near The Ranch was accepted by the Montana Department of Transportation, Adopt a Highway program. We now oversee cleanup efforts between mile marker 41 and 44 of the Skalkaho Highway – the main road that we use to access the unpaved Rock Creek Road that leads to The Ranch.\nAccounting Associate Danna Landry organized our acceptance into this program. “I grew up in Philipsburg. My childhood memories are full of green grass, flowers, blue skies, and pristine spaces as far as the eye can see. I want others to have the same memories as I do, and it begins when each of us takes just a little time to contribute. It was my way of giving back to a place that has taken care of me.”\nOn Wednesday, April 21, a crew of seven ranchers removed 12 bags of trash. Those involved commented that is was surprising how many things they removed were there for decades. They even found now-obsolete pull-top cans hidden in embankments with other trash. This hidden trash could have easily been washed into Rock Creek. A cleanup will happen every spring and more often if we see the need.\n3. Hosting a blood drive in our Buckle Barn\nCovid-19 impacted the Red Cross’ ability to do blood drives, reducing its blood supply. For people in Philipsburg, that makes it significantly harder to donate because we are 90 minutes from the nearest donation locations. When one of our beloved long-time employees was diagnosed with cancer in January, Assistant Pastry Chef Flynn Hall saw the number of blood donations that staff member needed to fight cancer and scheduled a blood drive as soon as the Red Cross resumed them.\nThe blood drive took place on Tuesday, April 20 in our Buckle Barn and 15 people, including Flynn herself, donated blood. The Red Cross remarked how many first-time blood donors there were. Encouraging new blood donors is important step in providing enough blood to emergency room, cancer and chronically ill patients. It is one another addition to our community sustainability efforts that we hope to continue in the future.\n“My cousin Caitie was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia at the same time one of our Ranchers was diagnosed with AML as well. Patients often need blood transfusions, due to a low count of red blood cells and platelets. I was unable to attend a blood drive back home so I thought it’s a good cause in honor of someone we love at The Ranch. It was really gratifying to see everyone supporting the cause as a donor, organizer or providing food for the event.” ~ Assistant Pastry Chef Flynn Hall\n4. Installing a Trout Unlimited fish screen\nThis winter and spring, and through snowstorms and rain, Trout Unlimited constructed a fish screen on an irrigation headgate on The Ranch to protect fish populations",
      "The Lost Girls\nA stunning debut novel that examines the price of loyalty, the burden of regret, the meaning of salvation, and the sacrifices we make for those we love, told in the voices of two unforgettable women linked by a decades-old family mystery at a picturesque lake house.\nIn 1935, six-year-old Emily Evans vanishes from her family’s vacation home on a remote Minnesota lake. Her disappearance destroys the family—her father commits suicide, and her mother and two older sisters spend the rest of their lives at the lake house, keeping a decades-long vigil for the lost child.\nSixty years later, Lucy, the quiet and watchful middle sister, lives in the lake house alone. Before her death, she writes the story of that devastating summer in a notebook that she leaves, along with the house, to the only person who might care: her grandniece, Justine. For Justine, the lake house offers freedom and stability—a way to escape her manipulative boyfriend and give her daughters the home she never had. But the long Minnesota winter is just beginning. The house is cold and dilapidated. The dark, silent lake is isolated and eerie. Her only neighbor is a strange old man who seems to know more about the summer of 1935 than he’s telling.\nSoon Justine’s troubled oldest daughter becomes obsessed with Emily’s disappearance, her mother arrives to steal her inheritance, and the man she left launches a dangerous plan to get her back. In a house haunted by the sorrows of the women who came before her, Justine must overcome their tragic legacy if she hopes to save herself and her children.\nPraise For The Lost Girls: A Novel…\n— Minneapolis Star Tribune\n“This book has it all — intrigue, complicated relationships, and a thrilling plotline — and it will appeal to fans of long-spanning ‘90s stories like Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias (yes that came out in ‘89 but you totally had the VHS in the ‘90s).”\n“A taut, intricately plotted novel.”\n— San Jose Mercury News\n“Young does a masterful job contrasting Lucy’s long-ago summer, her last happy one, with Justine’s dawning knowledge of how the effects of a family tragedy echo down through the years.”\n— Toronto Star\n“Suspenseful and finely wrought, Young’s tale is not easily forgotten.”\n“Beautifully written, THE LOST GIRLS will please suspense fans as well as those who love redemptive fiction. This is a big, bold, heart-wrenching book reminiscent of novels by Jodi Picoult, and is an excellent debut.”\n“Heather Young has crafted a gorgeous book that moves artfully back and forth through time, weaving a suspenseful tale steeped in generations of family secrets. Places hold memories, The Lost Girls reminds us so beautifully; places shape us, bind us, haunt us, but sometimes, they can redeem us, too.”\n— Jennifer McMahon, New York Times bestselling author of The Night Sister\n“Heather Young is a master weaver of plot, time, and character. Her prose is confident, her story ambitious. The result -- THE LOST GIRLS -- is a haunting and dynamic debut that never falters.”\n— Ivy Pochoda, author of Vistation Street\n“Heather Young’s clear, unsentimental writing is bracingly observant, psychologically astute, and suspenseful.

      "Little shop on Grand Ave fulfills the guitar dreams of curious customers—and its meticulous proprietor.\nBy Sally J. Clasen\nIn his workshop at the intersection of Grand Avenue and 13th Avenue, Mark Allred shows me the first acoustic guitar he made as a student of the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery. To the untrained eye, it looks impeccable. Allred, however, a certified luthier, is distracted by the miter alignment on the bottom, pointing out where the wood seams don’t join perfectly.\nMost would need a Hubble telescope to notice the so-called blemish, but Allred’s passion for craftsmanship, plus a self-described case of borderline obsessive-compulsive disorder, magnifies his concern.\nA deep respect for the finely built—and tuned—world of stringed instruments began as a matter of economics for Allred. A self-taught musician, he started playing in bands as a teenager in Southern California and couldn’t afford to hire someone else to repair his guitar.\n“As a nerd, I’ve always liked to figure out how things work—and being poor led me to fixing my own guitar, learning how it was made and why it sounded the way it did,” Allred says. “I also have a natural talent for detail. As a kid, I always wanted to make things in the wood shed.”\nAllred still repairs guitars (and ukuleles and banjos), but now he’s also building them for a living. His path to being a luthier was not a direct route—even though he used to drive past Roberto-Venn every day for three months as a delivery man for Dairy Maid. “I’d look at the school, but it didn’t really cross my mind at the time that I would go there some day,” says Allred, who’s also been a mechanic, a contractor and worked in the motorcycle-parts industry.\nHe finally made a career leap last year, enrolling in the nine-month program with urging from his wife, who said to Allred, “You can talk about guitars forever. These are your people.” A few months after graduating, in September 2014, he opened Allred Guitars & Guitar Repair, just a few doors down from the renowned guitar-making school.\nAllred’s small but orderly workspace—located in the back of his wife’s cat-friendly interior design company—is filled with the tools of his trade: specialty chisels, files, planers, routers, jigs, fiberboard templates and lacquer. When he describes the process of guitar making, he sounds more like a structural engineer than an artisan of a centuries-old tradition. He explains how the grain orientation, the thickness of the wood, the bracing system and the individual parts contribute to a guitar’s overall sound.\nIt’s obvious Allred has a knack for the technical requirements of luthiery, but he points out that basic interpersonal skills come in handy too. “You don’t even have to be a great guitar player,” he says, “but you have to be a good listener when interacting with customers.”\nAllred moonlights as the slide guitarist for the Phoenix-based punk grass band The Haymarket Squares and plays harmonica for the local rockabilly group The Shivereens. “I’m an OK guitarist whose bag of tricks isn’t as big as I’d like it to be, but what I have is pretty good,” he says, while plugging into a vintage amp for an impromptu performance of the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter”. “I know what a guitarist is talking about, for example, when he or she wants a sweet and melodic sound but also wants to dig in and play punchy and loud.”\nThe skill set to breathe musical life into an inanimate piece of wood and stretched strings is part of the creative thrill for Allred, who believes the sound of the perfect guitar only exists in his head. “I’m after many different targets, and there’s a lot of innovation and variation in building one,” he says. “A guitar can’t be everything; there’s always a compromise. But that’s what I love about it; you get to make it up as you go. Ultimately, the goal is that it sounds and plays well.”\nSuch was the case in Allred’s first major commission, a semi-hollow, five-string electric bass made almost entirely of mahogany that he built for Chuck Morris III of the band Jared and the Mill. “Not another one like it in the world,” Allred says of the instrument, which took four months to complete.\nAllred is still getting used to the idea that he is a business owner, but he’s proud to play a role in the revitalization of local arts and culture along Grand Avenue, where his shop is located. The once-decaying district west of downtown Phoenix now includes several independent art galleries, eateries and music/comedy venues.\n“I’m really excited to be part of Grand Avenue’s resurgence and the collection of artists, small business",

With cuts to mental health services actually starting to bite, digitised treatment could be simply the ticket for young adults who already filter almost every aspect of their lives– buddies, work, sex, home entertainment– through a screen.\nNot everybody is totally encouraged that shifting mental healthcare online is the method forward. “For me, what operate in treatment is when you fulfill somebody in person, in the very same space,” says London-based psychotherapist Sandra Tapie. “You learn more about not just what it resembles to talk with the person, but how it feels to be in a space with them. Using Skype is the next best thing: it’s ‘sufficient’, but it does not produce the nearness, the intimacy, that truly gets people to open up and explore things.”\n” I have actually performed some research into Skype counselling,” says London-based psychotherapist Dr Aaron Balick, “and it’s not the ‘functional equivalent’ of traditional counselling; it’s simply not quite the very same thing. It’s actually essential that individuals who take part in it understand that it’s a various experience from remaining in the room with someone, speaking face-to-face.”\n” In terms of accessibility, it’s an excellent start and definitely better than nothing. It’ll ideally lead them to eventually showing up in the room.\nIn",
      "Their lead in the Atlantic Division approaching Barcalounger comfort levels, the Bruins enjoyed a Sunday of slippers and naps after their proficient 4-0 dismissal of the Islanders the day before at Nassau Coliseum.\nBacked by Tuukka Rask’s fourth shutout of the season, they awoke Sunday with 16 games remaining in the regular season and a 7-point bulge over the Bolts, who learned over the weekend that they will be without star forward Steven Stamkos (surgery to repair abdominal/core injury) until at least the start of the postseason next month.\nThe Bolts, with a game in hand, might not be fully focused in the Bruins rearview mirror, but they also aren’t that object closer than the sideview mirror indicates. The Bruins own the league’s best record (41-13-12) and appear poised to wrap their sweaty leather mitts around their first Presidents’ Trophy since 2014.\nCoach Bruce Cassidy, his charges a sizzling 10-3-0 since returning from the bye break, now is enjoying the possible luxury of backing off the playing time of some of his leading TOI horses. He noted on Saturday that defenseman Charlie McAvoy could be among those in the stable he backs off a few shifts as the postseason approaches.\n“The Bergys, the Zs,” said Cassidy, identifying the likes of Patrice Bergeron and Zdeno Chara as a couple of other guys who might be backed off slightly down stretch. “And McAvoy’s played a lot of minutes, so maybe he needs a day off down the road.”\nCassidy also added core performers David Krejci, Brad Marchand, and David Pastrnak (league-leading 47 goals) as others who potentially could see a slightly TOI slimdown, all in the spirit of managing their fatigue levels, both mental and physical, as the prospect of potentially playing into mid-June again approaches.\nCassidy’s comments came before puck drop on Long Island, where, coincidentally, McAvoy went out and posted his best offensive line (1-2—3) of the season. Without a goal in the first half, he now has four strikes since the club returned from what it might soon be referring to as its January “Bye-bye!” break.\n“I mean, I feel good,” said McAvoy, whose 21:30 in ice time Saturday ranked third on the club, behind Brandon Carlo (22:59) and Chara (21:49). “I am sure that is something that we’d have a conversation about. Whatever he does, we trust him. He always has the best interests of his players in mind — so whatever minutes it is, I try to do the best I can for the team.”\nFor the season, McAvoy leads all Bruins in average ice time with 22:59, followed by his backline partner, Chara (20:59). Marchand (19:36), Pastrnak (19:03) and Bergeron (18:51) have punched the most time among the forwards.\n“Whatever minutes you get, you just want to go out there and play to the best of your ability when you’re called upon,” added McAvoy. “I try to take a lot of pride in that.”\n■ Sean Kuraly, center of the fourth line much of the season, lined up again as the L4 left wing on Saturday and logged a dependable 13:30, nearly a quarter of that on the PK. He also fired three shots, none landing on net, on a line that had Par Lindholm at center and Joakim Nordstrom at right wing.\n“Right now [Kuraly] will stay there,” said Cassidy. “I think he’s played a little bit better there. As long as Lindholm can handle it on a regular basis, we may stick with it going forward. We may look at another option in the middle there down the road, but right now that’s kind of how it’s worked out for us.”\nWho could be the other option? Possibly Jack Studnicka, among the club’s most prized prospects, who leads the AHL Providence WannaB’s in points (21-23—44). The first-year pro, the 53rd pick in the 2017 draft, has had a strong second half and turned 21 last month.\n■ McAvoy’s 1-2—3 afternoon accounted for the lion’s share of the 2-5—7 line submitted by the backline crew.\nIt was the biggest aggregate accumulated by Boston defensemen this season, and the first time the six pack outscored Boston’s 12 forwards.\nAsked post-game if that meant the forwards were buying dinner on the way home, a beaming McAvoy said, “They should",
      "We are back with our second installment in the AVE Raw series, giving a gorgeous set of pieces from Ave Home a fab new finish and sharing all the details along the way! As a group of like minded people, we certainly have use of a good furniture finish more than the average Joe. I am particularly excited about this project because it may very well be the easiest solution for a durable paint finish that sprays, yet doesn’t require expensive equipment to apply and isn’t difficult to work with or clean up. In fact, I can’t believe this didn’t occur to me earlier.\nI chose the Mollie Nesting Tables and they did not disappoint. Nesting tables are the ultimate multi-purpose tables, in my opinion. Use them as a chic end table, an accent table with extra display space or separate and scatter them about, you have 3 tables to work with, so go crazy.\nThe unfinished state the pieces from the AVE Raw collection arrive with is flawless. This is not an exaggeration. My thought is that if you are planning a finish that typically requires an immaculate sanding prior to application – you would be well suited to leave it well enough alone because it will be exactly that when it lands on your doorstep. If you plan to stain, then a good cleaning with a special thinner would be a great idea. It will remove any oils or dirt that occur during transit and packing, but otherwise – don’t touch with a sander as you run the risk of having any irregularities show once the stain has been applied.\nThat being said, a paint finish is an entirely different animal. The one thing you will experience regardless, is that when you apply a finish to a raw wood surface, it will open the pores of your wood and may cause that slightly rough textured appearance until you give it another coat of paint or a sealant. Many product lines suggest a light sanding in between coats and this is to solve for that and to help your second coat adhere to the first. But what about those products that do not want you to sand in between? Well no worries, another coat or two usually does the trick. This was certainly the case for the finish I used on these gorgeous nesting tables.\nI think we are all in agreement that an oil based finish is going to be far more durable than one that isn’t. But applying an oil based finish with a natural brush is no walk in the park. If you must go the way of applying your finish with a brush – switch to a roller with an ultra smooth nap and pretend you didn’t that portion of the instructions. Trust me on this. No amount of self-leveling properties the paint may have will actually solve for the brush marks and that doesn’t even take into account the cleanup. Enamel paints aren’t typically the most user friendly if you aren’t a pro in the finishing industry. I knew I needed the durability of a true enamel oil based finish for these tables, so I set out to find an easy solution for this and stumbled upon spray cans of oil based automotive paint. Duh. How did this never occur to me? It was the ultimate face-palm moment and once I set my sights on the color and sheen I was looking for, I was chomping at the bit for my paint to arrive.\nI used a matte black enamel automotive spray paint, and it is the most glorious finish you have ever laid eyes on, that wasn’t done in a professional setting. I always start a spray finish on the bottom, with my piece turned upsidedown.\nThis particular type of paint suggests a mere 15 minutes in between coats, which is fantastic since that is approximately the same amount of time I normally wait regardless of the suggestions on the can. I will chalk that up to my lack of patience. I continued to spray very light coats on the bottom sides until they appeared to be fully covered and the finish looked solid. If you have ever worked with an oil based paint, you will know what I mean by solid… hardened might also be a good word to describe what I mean. I let the finish cure for about 45 minutes before I turned the tables right side up and began the coat the top and any nooks and crannies that aren’t accessible from the bottom. I used 5 cans of paint to finish the three tables and they are glorious. I always use a spray can trigger when I am working with spray paint and it helps with fatigue – which allows for a smoother finish in the end.\nIt is always recommended that you use a primer on raw wood, but I did not and it is flawless. I would definitely suggest you do though, since it will likely solve for the open pores and help with adhesion – making your finish more durable and lasting. A primer is always the way to go if you have the option and in the case of automotive enamel… you do have the option! Since these are oil based products, you will definitely need to work in a well ventalated space, and preferably outside. No amount of venting",

      "Blocked fallopian tubes are one of the possible causes of female infertility. One may not come across the symptoms, but there are some risk factors to contend with which can increase the chance of developing one’s condition. The medical term for a blocked fallopian tube is tubal occlusion. In this article we have clearly explained about symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes.\nThe symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes are rather muscular tubes that are lined with delicate hair-like structures. These “hairs” do work in both directions; thus helping an egg to travel from the ovaries down to the womb (uterus) and also helping sperm travel up from the womb.\nEach fallopian tube does end in fimbriae, which are finger-like structures. The fimbriae catch and also guide an egg when the ovary does release it.\nThe fallopian tubes do play an important role in conception as they happen to be where most eggs are fertilized.\nIn case any part of the fallopian tube is damaged, for example, by surgery or an infection, they can also become blocked by scar tissue.\nSymptoms of blocked fallopian tubes\n- symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes do connect the ovaries to one’s uterus and also play an important role in fertility.\n- symptoms of Blocked fallopian tubes do not often present symptoms other than difficulty in conceiving. Doctors do typically class this as having tried to conceive for about 1 year without much success.\n- symptoms of blocked fallopian tube may indeed cause some women to experience symptoms such as pain in one’s pelvis or belly. This pain might also happen regularly, such as around the time of their period or even be constant.\n- Sometimes, symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes can rather cause a fertilized egg to get stuck. This is indeed referred to as an ectopic pregnancy.\nAn ectopic pregnancy may not necessarily always cause many symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes and is usually detected during a scan. However, some woman may also experience signs of pregnancy, such as suffering from stomach pain on one side of the body, or vaginal bleeding. Any woman who does suspect she has an ectopic pregnancy needs to seek immediate medical attention.\nCauses of blocked fallopian tubes\nFallopian tubes can also become blocked for a range of reasons, which include:\n• a history of pelvic infection\n• a previous burst appendix\n• having had a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea or even chlamydia\n• endometriosis does happen to be a condition that does cause the lining of the womb to grow outside of one’s uterus\n• history of abdominal surgery\n• hydrosalpinx, which a swelling as well as fluid at the end of a fallopian tube\nEffects on fertility\n- On account of a blocked fallopian tube getting pregnant may be difficult.\n- The female reproductive system is made up of the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes.\n- If a medical problem has affected any of these three areas, it may make getting pregnant more difficult.\n- Each of the two ovaries is well connected to the uterus by a fallopian tube. The ovaries store eggs and then release them randomly, with one ovary releasing an egg each month.\n- In case one fallopian tube is blocked, it may still be possible for an egg to be fertilized. If both are blocked, this is less likely.\nDiagnosis of blocked fallopian tubes\nBlocked fallopian tubes can indeed be difficult to be identified. The tubes can open as well as close, so it is not always easy to tell if they are blocked or even just closed.\nThere are three key tests to diagnose blocked fallopian tubes:\n- An X-ray test, known as a hysterosalpingogram or HSG. A doctor does inject a harmless dye into the womb, which should flow into the fallopian tubes. The stain is visible on an X-ray. If the fluid does not flow into the fallopian tubes, they may also have a blockage.\n- An ultrasound test, known as a sonohysterogram. This is also very similar to the HSG test but also uses sound waves to build up a picture of the fallopian tubes.\n- Keyhole surgery, known as a laparoscopy. A surgeon makes a small cut in the body and inserts a tiny camera to take pictures of the fallopian tubes from inside.\n- A laparoscopy is acknowledged as the most accurate test for blocked tubes. However, doctors may not actually recommend this test as an early diagnosis because it is invasive and cannot also treat the issue.\n- A doctor may also be able to suggest a possible diagnosis based on medical history. For example, a woman may have had a burst appendix in the past. In case the woman has had difficulty conceiving, this could suggest blocked fallopian tubes as a likely cause.\nTreatment and surgery for blocked fallopian tubes\nIt may",

      "Are you constantly feeling under the weather? Your thyroid may be the problem. Thyroid conditions are much more common than most people expect; they affect an estimated 12% of the American population (some 20 million people), and the majority of those affected are unlikely to realize they have a poorly functioning thyroid at all[i].\nThyroid problems can arise from autoimmune disease, as a result of chemotherapy, from certain medications, or even as a result of a genetic predisposition[ii].\nPeople suffering from thyroid dysfunction generally fall into one of two categories: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.\nWhat is Hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism is when your thyroid gland isn’t producing enough hormones for your body to function efficiently (as opposed to hyperthyroidism, where your thyroid is creating an excess of hormones).\nThe symptoms caused by hypothyroidism vary, but some of the most commonly reported are low body temperatures (below 98oF), digestive upset, cognitive dysfunction (i.e. difficulty concentrating or remembering), dry skin, insomnia, and difficulty losing weight.\nHypothyroidism is easily diagnosed with a simple blood test and is generally considered a lifelong condition that is managed with prescription medication.\nWhat is L-Tyrosine?\nL-Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid, which means that our bodies can normally produce it on our own (whereas “essential” amino acids are derived from our diets). Tyrosine’s job is to help the body manufacture thyroid hormones, as well as neurotransmitters like dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\nSome scientists refer to it as the “antidepressant” of amino acids, because the neurotransmitters Tyrosine is responsible for creating play a massive part in regulating our mood[iii].\nTyrosine is also a proteinogenic amino acid, meaning that it helps create important proteins that your body needs to function, and it helps produce melanin (the substance that is responsible for our skin, hair, and eye color).\nTyrosine is commonly used to help promote cognitive function in patients, i.e. learning, memory, and alertness. This has proven to be especially effective in patients suffering from high levels of stress[iv]. However, it is important to note that tyrosine does not lower the perception of stress; it only prevents cognitive decline in response to everyday stressors.\nA recent study conducted in December 2015 revealed that low tyrosine levels in the body appear to be strongly linked to low amounts of thyroid hormone[v].\nThis is likely because Tyrosine mixes with iodine in the body to create the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Without enough Tyrosine in the body, the thyroid can’t make these hormones, which means that your body loses the ability to regulate your metabolism.\nBenefits of Taking L-Tyrosine for Hypothyroidism\nTaking L-Tyrosine as a supportive supplement can help to combat cognitive dysfunction associated with hypothyroidism, in addition to supporting the thyroid gland in the creation of hormones T3/T4, and neurotransmitters.\nTyrosine can improve the health/ appearance of your skin and hair, and has also been shown to reduce stress in patients and encourage deep, restorative sleep. Tyrosine may also have potential in treating ADHD symptoms and Parkinson’s Disease[vi].\nRecent research suggests that Tyrosine has the potential to treat premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and certain substance dependencies or addictions[vii].\nIf you are taking L-Tyrosine, you should be careful to avoid food such as broccoli, Brussel sprouts, spinach, soybeans, etc. as all of these foods have a tendency to interfere with proper thyroid function, and can lead to an actual overdose of L-Tyrosine.\nL-Tyrosine is also a stimulatory amino acid, which means that it is likely to interact with other drugs or supplements. You should let your doctor know if you are taking any medications that affect your dopamine and norepinephrine levels (ex. Levodopa)[viii].\nYou should also avoid taking L-Tyrosine if you suffer from chronic migraine, as tyrosine can occasionally trigger migraine headaches and/or digestive upset.\nOther Treatment Options\nIn addition to taking L-Tyrosine, hypothyroidism is normally treated with a prescription of artificial thyroid replacement drugs like Synthroid or Cytomel.\nNatural supplements like Thyromate[ix], which contains L-Tyrosine along with other useful vitamins and minerals, may be prescribed in addition to artificial thyroid replacers to help support the thyroid.\nBecause maintaining the proper balance of thyroid hormones in your body is key to managing the condition, your doctor will likely need to monitor you for up to 8 weeks to ensure that you are on the correct dosage and that the medication is benefitting you.\nIf you suffer from hypothyroidism, or believe",
      "If You’re Looking for Me, I’m in the Pantry. And I Took the Rum.\n*Facebook: The girls are calling each other Soul Sisters instead of Step Sisters. I think it’s just an excuse to hear Gabby sing HEY SOUL SISTER at the top of her lungs.\nWe have three nine-year-old girls. As of right now, the biggest problem we have with them is the ongoing argument called, “Who did it?” (“IT” could be anything …) Here’s the basic script of the argument:\n1: Why did you do IT?\n2: I didn’t do IT\n3: Yes you did IT\n1: And I’m gonna tell Mom/Jody/Dad/Bill\n2: I DIDN’T!\n3: Yes you did\n1: Yes –huh!\nYes-huh? Who invented this? And why is it that the number of syllables applied to the word “uh” is directly proportional to anger of the child\ntalking whining? When I hear, “Nuh- uh-h-h-h-h-h” I run and hide in the pantry because I know someone is coming to get me soon. If the child delivering the multi-syllabic uh is also crying and/or throwing things, I’m always sure to grab the bottle of rum on my way to the pantry … I’m probably going to be in there for a while.\nApparently, our current nine-year-old issues are nothing compared to what we’re in for.\nI have the same conversation every time I meet someone new. First I tell the story of our family. It is a classic [divorced] Guy [with three kids] Meets [also divorced] Girl [with three kids]. “Oh! The Brady Bunch!” They exclaim. “How old are they?”\nI reply, “The boys are four and twelve, and the girls are five, nine, nine and nine.” “Wow,” they say, “three nine-year-old girls? Just you wait ‘til they are …” And this is where the story varies. Each person we meet has a different dangerous age we should be wary of, a different hellish story to go along with each number. In short, I’m pretty sure we’re in trouble for the next tewnty years or so …\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re all eleven! You’ll be happy if they’re yelling at you because that’s the only time they’ll ever speak to you! Unless they need a ride to the mall …” Oh, that sounds fun. Can’t wait.\n“Just you wait ‘till they’re all twelve! Can you imagine when they all get their periods at the same time? You know girls in one family always synch up, right?” Bill is especially scared of this one because there is the someday potential for five women in his house to be bitching at him at the same time. I do actually feel pretty bad for him—maybe I’ll show him the pantry hiding spot.\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re all fourteen and they start high school! They’ll all want a car and they’ll have a million different activities they’ll want to go to!” All that and an older brother who’s a senior…and has senior friends! Ahh! We’ll need some kind of screening process for the boys and some sort of tracking system for the car …\n(Perhaps we should just put the girls in the pantry.)\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re all fifteen and they hate your guts! No matter what you say is wrong!” Fifteen sounds scary because I’m pretty sure that’s the age I was when my dad took my door off its hinges to keep me from slamming it.\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re all sixteen and you have to throw three Sweet Sixteen parties!” I like throwing a party as much as anything, but sixteen-year-olds seem pretty dramatic and I’m pretty sure it’s tacky to drink rum at your kids’ birthday …\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re all eighteen and want to go to college at the same time!” We have a financial plan for this one. It’s called, “Winning the Lottery.” Plan B is called “Scholarships.” We’re pretty sure the girls could win scholarships for sports, academics and a beauty contest. We’ll let you try to figure out which one is which.\n“Just you wait ‘til they’re in their twenties and you have to throw three weddings!”\nYikes! I’m starting to hyperventilate. If you need me, I’ll be hiding in the pantry until they’re all twenty-five, graduated and married. I’m takin’ the rum. Don’t tell the kids where I am.\nCopyright © Jody Hoffman 2011\nIn the past year, I have gone from single mother of three to married mother/stepmother of six (plus two dogs!), from second grade teacher to sixth grade teacher, and from Boston City Girl to South Dakota Country Girl",
      "His successor was Basil II, who may have poisoned him. Basil was the son of Romanus II, and was not a proven general or a member of the Anatolian aristocracy, as had been Nicephorus Phocas and John Tzimisces. As a result, he had tremendous difficulty suppressing revolts and challenges to his throne. The effort to establish his throne took eleven years, and culminated with resort to Vladimir of Rus, Sviatoslav's son. In return for the Emperor's sister's hand in marriage, Vladimir provided 6,000 Varangian warriors. In 989, Basil was able to finally meet his chief nemesis, Bardas Phocas, whose forces were ultimately destroyed. The latter challenged Basil to a duel, but died of a stroke in the midst of his own charge. By 989, then, Basil had outfought his internal opponents, and had stewarded over Vladimir's marriage to Princess Anna, as well as Vladimir's entry into the Orthodox Christian fold, an event with tremendous cultural significance. From 990, Basil was able to concentrate on three things: 1) punishing and destroying of the re-emergent Bulgar state; 2) further securing of the Eastern border; and 3) clipping the wings of the Anatolian aristocracy and reinvigorating of the Theme armies' demographic basis.\nDuring the years of civil unrest in Byzantium, a certain Samuel had proclaimed himself Bulgar Czar. Starting from 980, he invaded Thessaly every year, in 986 capturing its capital Larissa. Basil countered by leading an army in person to meet Samuel. He was ambushed by the Bulgars, however, at Trajan's gate pass, and lost most of his forces. In 991, Basil returned to discipline the Bulgars definitively. Through 995, Basil's forces ranged through Thessaly. Though not winning any shocking victories, the methodical advances, rigorous discipline and planning, and careful precautions brought several cities and regions back to Byzantium. Forced to fight in the East for the next few years, Basil saw to the increased prestige and power of his client the Republic of Venice. It was now to guard the Dalmatian coast and protect the Greek-speaking cities from Samuel. From 1000-1014, Basil II undertook continuous campaigns in the Eastern Balkans. Advancing the whole time, in 1014, there was a momentous battle, at the narrow passes of Cimbalongus near the upper Struma River. The Bulgars were surprised and annihilated, with 15,000 taken prisoner. In an act earning him the name Bulgar-Slayer, or Bulgaroctonus, Basil sent these prisoners home in groups of 100--ninety-nine of each group were blinded, while their leader was left with one eye to guide them. Czar Samuel died upon seeing his returning army. In 1018, the Bulgars were finally eliminated as a political entity, and Basil personally occupied their capital. The entirety of the Balkan Peninsula was once more Byzantine.\nBasil's activities in the East were mostly defensive. In 995, the Fatimids put Aleppo under siege. It was now a Byzantine protectorate, so its amir appealed to Basil. Putting his entire army on mule-back, Basil rushed to Aleppo's defense. The Fatimids were defeated, and fled back to Damascus. To drive home his superiority, Basil sacked Emesa, and raided as far south as Tripoli before heading back west to face Bulgar issues. Returning to the region in 1023, he established eight new Themes, continuing northeast of Antioch. Byzantine dominance stretched to Azerbayjan, and at his death in 1025, Basil was planning an invasion of Sicily. One group was glad of his death. While in the east in 990-s, Basil was angered by the degree of large landholder control in the area. Their estates had expanded both onto imperial lands as well as onto the local village communes--those centers on which Theme soldiers depended for support. Thus, while individual Byzantine elites, and even generals, were enriched, the state and army ran the risk of impoverishment. On January 1, 996, Basil decreed that for a claim to land to be valid, it had to go back to Romanus I Lecapanus, sixty-one years before. Thus, much of the Anatolian aristocracy were immediately deprived of their lands--the Phocas family, having produced Nicephorus the emperor, lost almost all their estates, while other families were reduced to beggary. The peasants, and small holders, however, were now empowered to regain lost lands. When Basil died and his inadequate brother Constantine VIII became emperor, the land",
      "With all that has happened since beginning of March, we thought it would be a good time to give an overall update on what our business is doing and how the COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus has changed the landscape for a construction company like Reliance. We’ve been in business over 15 years. For the first time we find ourselves in circumstances where continuing work as usual presents a challenge to the health and safety of our team and clients. We have never backed away from a challenge and now we have implemented new measures to help us through these difficult times.\nOn Monday March 23rd as the first order of Stay Home Safe was passed by governor Newsom, we had to contact our clients and schedule last minute job site meetings to update everyone on the immediate changes necessary. It was a challenging moment for us and our clients but with the possibility of a deadly virus lurking around, we had to plan for the safety of everyone involved in our work. We had to monitor operations more closely and limit interactions on each job sites immediately. In order to accommodate this, we had to stretch our job schedules and ensure that no enclosed space would have more than 3-5 people actively working at any one time. While these procedures caused some obvious delays, we did our best to communicate with our clients and our team alike and keep the wheels turning. We also ensured all job sites had access to plenty of running water, soap, and wash station immediately.\nIn the weeks that followed, we all understood the scope of the pandemic and adapted daily. With pending projects in the permit approval process at the City of Los Angeles and Culver City Department of Building and Safety, we had to ensure our permits were still in process and moving forward. A phone call to the planning department let us know that things are up and running but with certain delays and new measures. Neither departments are allowing face to face interactions with plan examiners and over the counter permits are no longer an option. All plans and applications are dropped off at the front door and communication is solely through emails or phone calls. This is certainly delaying the planning and permitting process but the good news is that they are still working and permits are being issued.\nCheck out our post from the Los Angeles Building Department drop-off on our Instagram Page at https://www.instagram.com/reliancedesignbuild/\nAs we get closer to the re-opening of offices we continue to:\nOur team of architects and interior designers are working from home and our contractors are still at job sites pushing forward with limited employees working at any one time. We are following all social distancing measures, ensuring everyone has face coverings and keeping our hands, tools and work spaces clean and safe. Our current addition and ADU in Culver City is in its final stages of punch-out. Our other projects in Mar Vista and Los Angeles are also moving forward with limited number of tradesmen working daily. These projects are unoccupied which allow us to minimize one-on-one interactions between our job site team and our clients. Clients see daily log of job site activities and photos posted by job site manger via Basecamp. However, we still hold weekly client meeting to keep them updated on our progress. In short, we are doing all we can to move forward without compromising the health and safety of those working for us and our clients. We are happy to report that to date, we have seen no signs of COVID-19 amongst our team members.\nAs always, the construction industry is dependent on the real estate market, financing and state of economy. As we clearly experience these challenging times, we must consider the effects on the state of our industry too. Number of job losses are at an all time high and indications of a recession are everywhere we look. With that said, this time around we as a nation seem to be dealing with something much different than the 2008 collapse of the financial sector. Our markets are showing better resilience. Home prices continue to rise and consumer confidence is still high. The for sale inventory is short of demand in most parts of the country. Interest rates are very low which means we can still borrow and refinance in order to access funds needed for the next home improvement project. What truly lies ahead is unknown for the best of economists but we know that most markets are not responding the same as they did in last recession. The construction industry seems to be holding steady and we are happy to provide our services.\nTake a look at some very helpful articles about the Coronavirus and the real estate market here: https://www.redfin.com/guides/coronavirus-real-estate?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1022236\nYou might ask: what should I do about my next project? Well, the answer is not that complicated. We say: Start Planning!\nWe are here with an abundance of time to help you plan your next project. Our services are not just about building and construction.

      "Congratulations on your decision to read this book, Sams Teach Yourself PL/SQL in 21 Days, Second Edition!\nIf you are new to the Oracle\nenvironment, this book will help you learn and master Oracle's built-in\nprocedural language quickly. Knowledge of PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured\nQuery Language) is becoming a fundamental necessity no matter which of\nOracle's many products you use.\nToday, on your first day, you will accomplish these tasks:\nLearn what PL/SQL is and why you should master it\nLearn how PL/SQL relates to other Oracle products\nLearn what resources you need to finish this book\nWrite your first PL/SQL function\nOver the remaining 20 days, you'll delve deeper into the power and\ncapabilities of this language and learn how to leverage its power in your\napplications regardless of whether you are doing client/server programming with\nOracle's tools (such as Developer/2000), using other front-end tools (such\nas PowerBuilder), or simply writing some batch jobs that run on the server.\nWhat Is PL/SQL?\nPL/SQL is a procedural language that Oracle developed as an extension to\nstandard SQL to provide a way to execute procedural logic on the database.\nNew Term - If you have worked with relational\ndatabases in the past, you are no doubt familiar with SQL, which stands for\nStructured Query Language. SQL itself is a powerful declarative language.\nIt is declarative in the sense that you describe the results that you\nwant but not how they are obtained. This is good because you can insulate an\napplication from the specifics of how the data is physically stored. A competent\nSQL programmer can also push a great deal of processing work back to the server\nlevel through the creative use of SQL.\nThere are limits, though, to what you can accomplish with a single\ndeclarative query. The real world is seldom as neat and clean as we would like\nit to be. Developers often find themselves needing to execute several queries in\nsuccession and process the specific results of one query before going on to the\nnext. This leads to two problems in a client/server environment:\nThe procedural logic, that is, the definition of the process, resides on\nThe need to look at the data from one query and use it as the basis for\nthe next query results in an increased amount of network traffic.\nWhy are these problems? The procedural logic on client machines can quickly\nbecome out of sync if the software is upgraded. It can also be implemented\nincorrectly, resulting in a loss of database integrity. The need to pull down\nlarge amounts of intermediate data to a client results in a long wait for the\nend users who must sit there staring at the hourglass while the data is\ntransferred to their machines. The cumulative effects of a number of clients\npulling large amounts of data across the network further decrease\nPL/SQL provides a mechanism for developers to add a procedural component at\nthe server level. It has been enhanced to the point where developers now have\naccess to all the features of a full-featured procedural language at the server\nlevel. It also forms the basis for programming in Oracle's continually\nevolving set of client/server development tools, most notably\nWhy Learn PL/SQL?\nIf you are developing with Oracle products, Developer/2000 for example, the\nanswer to this question is simple. You need to know PL/SQL because those\nproducts use PL/SQL for any procedural code. But what if you don't develop\nwith Oracle's products? What if all you use is Oracle's database\nengine? Is PL/SQL of any use to you? Yes! Absolutely it is.\nRegardless of the front-end tool that you are using, you can use PL/SQL to\nperform processing on the server rather than the client. You can use PL/SQL to\nencapsulate business rules and other complicated logic. It provides for\nmodularity and abstraction. You can use it in database triggers to code complex\nconstraints, which enforce database integrity; to log changes; and to replicate\ndata. PL/SQL can also be used with stored procedures and functions to provide\nenhanced database security. Finally, it provides you with a level of platform\nindependence. Oracle is implemented on many hardware platforms, but PL/SQL is\nthe same on all of them. It makes no difference whether you are running Personal\nOracle on a laptop or Oracle8i Enterprise on UNIX.\nRegardless of what development tools you use, if you are developing in an\nOracle environment, your knowledge of PL/SQL and your ability to apply it will\ngive you a competitive advantage against those who do not have that knowledge.\nWith PL/SQL you have the power to make your applications more robust, more\nefficient, and more secure.\nSQL, SQL*Plus, PL/SQL: What's the Difference?\nThis question has bedeviled many people new to Oracle.

      "When it comes to user perception of IT within an enterprise, there is no doubt that the Service Desk remains one of the major drivers of customer experience.\nITIL 4 defines the Service Desk as an entry and single point of contact for all users, where demand for incident resolution and service requests are received by the service provider. And while self-service portals and AI powered chatbots are all the rage in handling user issues nowadays, there is still room for the human touch—particularly where empathy is required and complexity is encountered.\nSo, what do employees of a service desk do? Let’s look at the service desk support analyst role, including typical responsibilities.\nWhat does a service desk support analyst do?\nDepending on the organization, formal titles for this job may be “service desk support analyst” or “help desk support analyst” or simply service/help desk support. (Some companies recognize a difference between service desk and help desk, but we’ll use the term interchangeably here.)\nNo matter your title, if you’re working in a service desk or help desk environment, you’re serving as the first, perhaps only, point of contact between an end user and your company.\n- User query/issue handling. Ensuring user queries or issues are captured, validated, and triaged for further processing.\n- Communicating with users. Ensuring that various types of information are communicated to users through the appropriate channel(s).\n- Optimization.Ensuring improvement of the two previous processes through analysis, reviews, and reporting, as well as through automation, competence building, knowledge sharing and other organizational changes.\nThe service desk is one portion of your company’s overarching IT service management strategy. Here are additional career paths in ITSM:\nStructure of a service desk\nTraditionally, the functional unit(s) of a service desk are layered in a form that supports escalation where issues of greater magnitude or priority are forwarded to staff with higher skill sets, regularly termed level 1, 2 and 3, and beyond that to vendors who may have similar structures.\nOf course, the more the tiers, the greater the challenge of providing a coordinated response. This often results in a degraded customer experience due to multiple handovers and challenges in status tracking. Some service desks have specialized functions which limit routing and reduce response time. Modern approaches such as Shift Left advocate for the reduction in these layers, by bringing the support closer to the user. Swarming, which promotes teamwork over level-by-level escalation, encourages the initial point of contact seeing the issue through to resolution.\nAs technology changes, so too will the role of the service desk. The ITOps Times reported that the Service Desk will take the role of “Uber for Business”, supporting tech-savvy employees with knowledge on the latest IT-approved applications available on their service portal or any app store.\nService desk standards\nSome frameworks standardize the work performed on the service desk. The European e-Competence Framework (e-CF) defines “Service Support” as one of its 40 ICT Professional Role Profiles in the Service and Operation Family, whose purpose is to provide remote or onsite diagnosis or guidance to internal or external clients with technical issues. The main tasks of this role, which fits very well with what is expected in the Service Desk, include:\n- Identify and diagnose issues and problems\n- Categorize and record reported queries and provide solutions\n- Support problem identification\n- Advise users on appropriate course of action\n- Monitor issues from start to resolution\n- Escalate, if needed, unresolved problems to a higher level of support\n- Provide essential online security advice and support\nOn the other hand, SFIA 7 does not have a specific competence titled as “Service Desk” but does reference the Service Desk in the “Customer Service Support” skill which is listed under the Client Interface category of ‘Relationships and Engagement’ and sub category ‘Stakeholder Management’. The skill is defined as follows:\n- Managing one or more customer service or service desk functions.\n- Acting as a point of contact to support service users and customers reporting issues, requesting information, access, or other services.\n- Delivering customer service through multiple channels including human, digital, self-service, and automated.\nExamples of service desk tasks and responsibilities\nDrawing from both the e-CF and the SFIA 7, here are common examples of service desk tasks. Though these indicate levels within a traditional tiered framework, these competencies are applicable to most service desk approaches:\nLevel 1 (Entry level)\n- Receives and handles requests for service, following agreed procedures.\n- Promptly allocates calls as appropriate.\n- Logs incidents and service requests and maintains relevant records:\n- Identifies and classifies incident types and service interruptions\n- Records incidents cataloging them by symptom and resolution\n- Acts under guidance to record and track reliability data for your services\n- Systematically interprets user problems and identifies solutions and possible side effects.\n- Uses experience to address user problems and interrogates database for potential solutions.\n- Escalates complex or unresolved incidents.\n- Records and tracks issues from outset to",
      "By Danièle Cybulskie\nIf you’ve ever seen A Knight’s Tale, you’ll know that the titular knight takes on the name of Ulrich von Liechtenstein in order to joust on the tournament circuit and win the hand of his lady fair. What you may not have known is that there seems to have been a real thirteenth-century knight named Ulrich von Liechtenstein, who spent his youth jousting to win the heart (and body) of a capricious lady, and then wrote a book about it. Ulrich’s book is simply called The Service of Ladies (all references here are to the J.W. Thomas translation), and it is a fascinating tale of tournaments, ladies, and unrequited love (or maybe just lust).\nAccording to Ulrich, he spent four years of his childhood as the page of a (never-named) married noblewoman. He learned as he grew that the greatest ambition for a knight was to serve a lady steadfastly and well, and to hope to be rewarded for such good service – preferably by becoming the lady’s lover. Ulrich took this to heart, bringing his lady flowers, and even going so far as to secretly drink the water she used to wash her hands before eating. Eventually, he had to leave that household to learn how to become a knight, and he began tourneying in order to win himself (and his lady) honour in his late teens. He claims to have been one of two hundred and fifty knights to be knighted by Leopold of Austria at his daughter’s wedding.\nRealizing that his lady has no idea that Ulrich’s tournament successes are dedicated to her, he decides to ask her to accept his service by using his aunt as a go-between, sending the lady a love song to please her. The lady accepts the song, and remembers Ulrich’s service fondly, but refuses his love and service because of his “most unsightly lip”. In speaking to a friend, Ulrich mentions that his mouth “looks like three lips,” so it’s possible he had a cleft palate or other long-standing physical difference. This is worth mentioning not only because it shows the shallowness of the lady, but because Ulrich opts for surgery to correct his lip, and then tells us about it.\nAt first, his aunt and friends try to dissuade him – after all, any medieval surgery was potentially life-threatening – but Ulrich is determined, and finds himself a specialist in Graz who will operate. The doctor recommends that Ulrich is bound to keep him from moving, but Ulrich in his knightliness never moves “a fraction of an inch,” despite the surgeon’s cutting.\nAfter a long recovery, Ulrich’s mouth is declared “just fine” by his aunt, but Ulrich’s lady is only marginally impressed. She allows him to ride by her to speak his mind, but when he is too shy to speak, she tears out a lock of his hair while he lifts her down from the saddle as his just desserts. This is only one of the strange and violent episodes of this tale of chivalry. Another occurs when Ulrich severs a finger and sends a messenger to the lady for sympathy as it is slowly healing back onto his hand. She accuses his messenger of lying; after all, it doesn’t count as severed if it’s healing. As repentance, Ulrich re-severs the finger and sends it to her (she accepts it).\nThe central event of The Service of Ladies is an extended tour of southern Europe (referred to as the Journey of Venus) which Ulrich undertakes, dressed throughout in the guise of Queen Venus, in honour of love. On this tour, he gives out scores of gold rings, one for every knight who breaks a lance on him. He sends out advance notice to the cities he is going to visit, and knights come out in every city to win honour in the name of their own ladies against this knight in disguise. Although the description of the tour is much like Malory’s Morte D’Arthur in that there are lots of splitting lances, lovely ladies appearing, and knights of unsurpassed chivalry, it’s fun to poke through and see what might have been true in this sea of larger-than-life moments. One of my favourites is the countess who insists that Queen Venus lift her veil to receive the kiss of peace at mass: although she laughs when she recognizes him as a man, she kisses him anyway, on behalf of all womankind.\nDespite all his efforts winning glory during his Journey of Venus (with a brief stopover to visit his actual wife), his lady is still unimpressed, and accuses him of being devoted to another woman (presumably not his wife). She then tests him again by making him stand outside her castle with the lepers, disguised as one himself, and leaving him to sleep out in the rain. The lady then decides to let him climb up a bedsheet to her chamber, but only to thank him",

Photos (2) (3) (4)\n|How These Leading Nigerian Startups Raised Millions Of Dollars In Equity by segello: 8:40am On Sep 17, 2015|\nStartups are changing the world, and a Nigeria is joining in this wave. Startup businesses and their activities are having a far-reaching ripple effect on the socio-economic fabric of the demography in which they operate. They impact on customers by offering specialized products or service, they generate employment and pay taxes to the government amongst other benefits.\nIn Nigeria, we are beginning to see our own fair share of startups spring up in numbers aided with the rise in technological advancement. Over the past few years startups that spring to mind here in Nigeria include names like Konga, Hotels.ng, Iroko TV, Jobberman, Simple pay, BudgIT and others.\nThe purpose of this article is to find out how these startups raised equity to run their businesses.\nKonga.com is a Nigerian e-commerce website and an online shopping mall launched in July 2012 by Sim Shagaya. On the website one can get everything from electronics, computers, mobile phones, refrigerators, books and fashion accessories delivered to you within 24 hours.\nShortly after launching in 2012, Konga raised a $3.5 million seed round from investment AB Kinnevik. In early 2013, Konga raised a $10million series A round from investment AB Kinnevik and Naspers.\nIn late 2013, Konga finalized a $25 million series B round from previous investors, Investment AB Kinnevik and Naspers, the largest single round raised by a single African startup at the time.\nIn late 2014, Konga finalized a $40 million series C round from Investment AB Kinnevik and Naspers, the largest single round raised by a single African startup to date. It is worth noting that Konga received $13.5 million worth of orders during its 2014 Black Friday Promotion.\n2. Simple Pay\nSimple Pay is an innovative payments platform that allows users with an e-mail address and a bank account to securely and conveniently send and receive payments online. It was founded in 2013 by Simeon Ononobi who had a plan to solve the problems associated with making payments in Nigeria such as the hefty costs for payment gateways and the drudgery and unsafe exposure of personal debit and credit card details on multiple sites.\nSimple Pay pitched at the 2013 edition of the Seedstars world startup competition where the company was able to raise $330,000.\nThe company also went for the global event in Geneva, Switzerland where it witnessed a rain of investment proposals from local and international money bags.\nItalian investment consultancy conglomerate CBO Group were the first to jump on Simple Pay’s wagon after Simeon’s pitch in Switzerland. The CBO Group offer was $2 million.\nHotels.ng founded in 2013 by Mark Essien is Nigeria’s first online hotel booking portal which provides affordable, safe and convenient online bookings for Nigerian hotels for both tourist and business travelers. It currently has a listing of more than 7,000 hotels in 21 regions across Nigeria and has facilitated up to 2 million hotel reservations since its inception.\nIn an interview with Vanguard Mark Essien said “when you are building a startup, the first thing you need to do is to make sure you are in the right market”.\nHe also said “ you have to tell your story, if you do that, people will read about it, they know about you, they get a feeling of who you are so that you will be able to attract funding. That was what we were able to do fast.\nHotels.ng raised $1.2 million from the Omidyar Network, the investment vehicle of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and EchoVC Pan-Africa Fund, a seed-stage technology fund.\n4. Iroko TV\nIroko TV was launched in 2011 by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter.\nNjoku was inspired to start the company when he found it difficult to obtain Nollywood movies online for his mother, who he was living with abroad at the time. He researched the Nollywood industry and noted a lack of infrastructure in place for the international",

      "10 Forbidden Places No One Will Ever Be Allowed to Visit\nMight as well leave these ones off your bucket list.\nSnake Island, Brazil\nBrazil’s Ilha da Queimada Grande—dubbed Snake Island—is home to a dense population of one of the world’s deadliest snakes. The golden lancehead viper’s venom is so poisonous that it melts human flesh around the bite, and some claim there’s one snake per square meter in certain areas. For safety reasons, the Brazilian government doesn’t allow visitors, and a doctor is required on the team of any research visits.\nU.N. buffer zone, Cyprus\nTurkish troops invaded Cyprus in 1974, sparking a civil war between the Greek and Turkish inhabitants. When the fighting ended in a ceasefire, the United Nations took control of a no-man’s land “buffer zone” in the country’s capital, Nicosia. There, walls separate the Turkish community in the North (which Turkey, but no other countries, recognizes as a separate state) from the Greek community in the South. Behind the walls are abandoned homes and businesses. Some “Civil Use Areas” allow civilians, but other areas have been practically untouched for decades, much like these eerie abandoned airports.\nTomb of the Qin Shi Huang, China\nFarmers discovered the tomb of China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in 1974, and archaeologists have since found about 2,000 clay soldiers and expect there are another 8,000 still uncovered. Despite the excavation, the Chinese government has forbidden archaeologists from touching the central tomb with Qin Shi Huang’s body, which has been closed since 210 B.C.E. The decision is partly to respect the dead, but also from fear that current technology isn’t up to snuff for excavating without damaging the ancient artifacts. The whole thing is reminiscent of the mysterious chamber scientists recently found in the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nOn April 26, 1986, an explosion near Chernobyl, Ukraine, (which was then in the Soviet Union) became the worst nuclear accident in history. Although the death counts caused by radiation are impossible to pin down, experts estimate between 9,000 and one million people will die of cancer from radiation. More than 30 years since the disaster, cleanup projects are still undergoing, and the power plant’s director guesses the area won’t be inhabitable for at least 20,000 years.\nArea 51, Nevada\nThe U.S. government wouldn’t admit Area 51 existed until 1992 documents released in 2013 mentioned the Nevada military base. Officials still haven’t revealed what type of research goes on, though conspiracy theorists claim alien activity is studied there. You can get a birds-eye view of the spot on Google Maps, but the sprawling desert makes it hard for anyone to sneak in, and security is tight. Even visitors with security clearances reach Area 51 on private planes that keep the windows drawn until landing. This is only one of many ways Area 51 stays so secretive.\nNorth Sentinel Island, India\nIn the Bay of Bengal sit the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, most of which are Indian territories. The Sentinelese tribe of North Sentinel Island is thought to have been there for 60,000 years, and it’s one of the last communities in the world to remain totally isolated from outside societies. In 2006, the boat of two fishermen drifted to the shallows of North Sentinel Island, where the Sentinelese killed the pair. Since then, there have been other reports of the tribe shooting arrows at passing helicopters. Because the Sentinelese haven’t been in contact with the diseases others have built resistance to, contact with outsiders could prove deadly to the tribe, so the Indian government has agreed not to attempt any contact. Don’t miss these other 25 weird international laws you’d never believe are real.\nVatican Secret Archives, Vatican City\nHoused in a heavily protected area of the Vatican are 53 miles of shelves containing documents relating to the Catholic Church, dating as far back as the eighth century. Some artifacts include a letter from Mary Queen of Scots begging Pop Sixtus V to save her from beheading and documents of Martin Luther’s excommunication. The archive opened to researchers in 1881, but it isn’t easy to get a pass inside. Researchers who apply for access can only have access for up to three months, and no more than 60 scholars are allowed in at once.\nFort Knox, Kentucky\nThe Fort Knox vaults, home to most U.S. gold reserves, have been deemed the most heavily guarded place on the planet. No single person can make it into the vault; several combinations need to be entered to gain access, and various staff members know just one.

The U.S. ground involvement in Vietnam was quickly approaching its fifth anniversary, and the violence was about to spread into Cambodia and Laos. Peaceful protests against the war were becoming less and less peaceful, eventually leading to the killing of four Kent State students by Ohio National Guardsmen little over three months after the films release.\nThis is the world the film M*A*S*H was released into. The ’60s had become the ’70s, and turmoil was the rule of the day. And the film reflects this tumult in its contradictory nature. It is unabashedly an anti-war film, but one as subtle as it is in your face, as silly as it is smart.\nThe film opens with new doctors Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) and Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland) arriving at the 4077th, a field hospital three miles from the front lines in South Korea. The pair finds out that the days at the M*A*S*H unit are long periods of absolute boredom interrupted by manic bursts of hyperactivity in the O.R.. In order to stay sane, the doctors resort to sex, booze and wacky pranks to fill up their days. Their comedy schtick doesn’t set well with bible-thumping Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and straight-laced Margaret O’Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), who wish the boys would shape up or ship out. However, Burns and O’Houlihan are soon outmatched when a new surgeon, Trapper John McIntyre (Elliot Gould), joins Forrest and Pierce to create even more anarchy.\nFor those of you familiar only with the M*A*S*H television show, you might be wondering who that Duke Forrest is. And, while watching the film for the first time, might get a bit anxious for Max Klinger to show up. The thing is, while the film was adapted from from the same source material, Richard Hooker’s 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors (based loosely on Hooker’s –real name was Dr. H. Richard Hornberger–experiences in Korea), the TV series wasn’t exactly adapted from the feature film. There are similarities, most notably Gary Burgoff’s Radar appearing in both, but each varies from the source material in its own special way.\nThis was the third feature film of Robert Altman’s storied career. Altman was at the time known mostly for his television work and had 1967’s Countdown (which also featured Duvall and Michael Murphy, who appears in M*A*S*H as an anesthesiologist friend of Hawkeye’s) and 1969’s That Cold Day in the Park (also featuring Murphy, who would become a frequent collaborator of Altman’s) as the entirety of his film resume to that point. But it was his television background that helped him the most here, because M*A*S*H isn’t really a film. It’s a series of scenes held together by a common theme. There is no real narrative to the film, no rising action/climax/resolution either. Duke and Hawkeye are essentially the same people at the end of the movie as they are at the beginning. It is what the novel was–a series of wartime reminiscences collected all in one place with the thinnest connective tissue holding them together.\nAs I mentioned above, it was an anti-war movie but a subtle one. No, there would be no character giving an impassioned, garment ripping speech about man’s inhumanity to man, no obvious tales of innocence lost, and no big character arc that show how war changes a man. The one character that goes insane was not from the horrors of war but from the horrors of teasing by Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke. Altman, a World War II veteran himself, shows how war really was for the warrior. It sucked, but you cope the best way you can. For Trapper and Hawkeye, it was acting like the Marx Brothers on acid.\nWhere Altman gets the anti-war message across is in the surgery scenes. The director did not hold back in presenting brutal reality of war in these scenes. The operating room was full of so much blood and gore that you’d think you were watching a Herschell Gordon Lewis film. The doctors’ pristine white surgical gowns are constantly dyed red with human blood. There’s a particularly gruesome scene where blood sprays out of a wounded soldier’s neck like a fountain. It’s horrific, and it’s meant to be. And the doctor’s laissez faire, “bring in the next one” attitude towards the victims, a necessity in this case, makes all the more horrifying. It shows what the true cost of war is in dying color.\n",
      "Album Of The Week / Dickless Tracy’s brutally enthralling Death Metal excellence\nFrom The Abyss: 15 September 2021\nSlovenia’s Deathgrind legends, Dickless Tracy, named themselves after a wordplay in the film The Hard Way (starring Michael J. Fox and James Woods), and although the name brings many different and mostly unserious interpretations and sniggering, including initially, many years ago, from myself, behind the name the music carries serious meaning.\nBut if it draws attention for the wrong reason and gets the right result, then it’s a winner. I may not have given them that initial listen and missed out on some superb albums.\nDickless Tracy – Grave New World (Monsterbilly Records)\nRelease Date: 15 September 2021\nWords: Jools Green\nFormed way back in ’97, over the years, they’ve edged away from their initial pure Grindcore sound and melded in that slightly crusty Death Metal element which makes this their fifth studio album, Grave New World, an eleven-track forty-six-minute chunk of brutally enthralling excellence.\nMassively crushing sound\nGrave New World is such an engaging and accessible listen. The line-up, twenty-four years later, has seen many changes but still contains founders, brothers Tomi Cepanec on vocals and guitars and Ivan Cepanec on drums joined by long term bassist Jernej Rejc, completing the trio and this massively crushing sound.\nThe title, Grave New World, is also an intriguing play on words and features nine new songs, one re-recorded number, and one never released single, looking at the subjects of “death in different forms, mainly the causes of death: consumerism, war, religion, and human influence on the environment.”\nThe album opens with Deathless, a Lovecraftian influenced number, a chunky and well-punctuated driver of a track. This is followed by Dawn Of The Living Dead, a largely unrelenting brute of a track that takes a dig at mindless consumerism, mid-way plunging into a distorted drop away, levelling out into a hypnotic driving plod, ramping back up for a final frontal assault to close.\nPathetic Descendant Of Apes is brutal in delivery and equally brutal in its appraisal of the “human” with a catchily filthy and driving undercurrent that drags you along in this raw but engaging beast of a track.\nI love the opening bass lines on The Apostles Of Terror, a powerful track from all perspectives. Initially, a chunky punchy plodder that shines a harsh light on the brutal doctrine behind certain religious beliefs, the pace builds like an angry out of control fervour. The sinister drop towards the close adds even more impact before one more brutal assault, flowing seamlessly into the title track, Grave New World.\nThis makes a stark commentary on the state of humanity as seen by Dickless Tracy, and for me, the repeated line “Anti-human humanity, grave new world, of cruelty”, in many respects, sums the situation up perfectly. Sound-wise, it boasts some superbly crunchy and catchy repeat Death riffs.\nMorphing Into Maelstrom, also, to my mind, lyrically, has an eerie Lovecraftian feel, the repeating waves of intense riffs compounding that eerie, unnerving quality.\nDevoured From The Inside, lyrically is the stuff of horrors, looking at the terrifying condition, Necrotizing Fasciitis, the rare but serious, often deadly bacterial infection, in all its gory depths. The opening gory blood-curdling growl, the frantic riffing, and surging pace reflecting the uncontrolled raging infection as it speeds out of control.\nFaydark Forest is undoubtedly not about the gaming realm inhabited by elves. This seems way more sinister, a realm of nightmares and death, a driving beast of a track that packs a brutal punch, made all the more insane by spiralling and squealing riffs, the second half drop into utter brutality, an even bigger shock to the system.\nThis cleverly constructed track is full of surprises with every twist of direction, and the vocal delivery also goes the extra mile in terms of style, range, intonation and protraction.\nFaydark Forest “speaks about the inner struggles, and the lyrics were written by guitarist/vocalist Tomi,” drummer Ivan Cepanec says. “Music-wise, it is our tribute to evil-sounding, twisted Death Metal in the vein of legendary New York bands Suffocation, Immolation and Incantation, and the middle part features a clear nod to the all-time class-sick Morbid Angel track, Immortal Rites.\n“It was the first song we wrote for this album, dating back in early 2015. It was also the first song we used to play live before recording the album. Play it loud! So be it!”\nThe next track title, Dissection Of",
      "I have made a number of small corrections to the article. I like it; it is short and to the point.\nYou can see my corrections just by clicking 'article', then 'revisions', then 'compare selected versions'.\nI put some explanation on what polychrony is. Also, I included the following paragraph:\nLuczak et al. (2007) showed that reproducible precise firing patterns can appear at the beginning of transitions from down- to up-states in vivo in anesthetized and awake rats (see UP and DOWN States). The exact mechanism of generation of such patterns is not known, but it most probably relies on the fact that pyramidal neurons exhibit reproducible latencies (delays up to 500 ms) to the first spike when stimulated with an injected step of dc-current or injected conductance (via dynamic clamp). Different neurons have different latencies resulting in stereotypical patterns of transition from down- to up-states.\nthis is a nicely written article which provides a broad overview of the topic in a clear and compact manner.\nI have only a few minor remarks and suggestions:\nSec.1, 1st par.:\nThe notion \"stable mode of transmission\" is maybe unclear at this point. I would rather say something like \"the only firing mode that allows a (stable) transmission of information\". Asynchronous activity --the ground state-- can be stable, too (Tetzlaff et al., 2002), but it can hardly serve as a signal carrier.\nSec.1, 1st par.:\n\"This was shown ... in the slice.\"\n\"Slice\" of what? Rather say \"in-vitro in cortical slices.\"\nSec.3, 2nd par.:\n\"With the synfire memory capacity described below (Sec.4)\"\nSec.4, 2nd par.:\n\"As pointed out by Maass,...\"\nCan you provide the full reference?\nSec.4, 4th par.:\nThe reference (Tetzlaff et al., 2002) is not correct. We discussed the embedding of synfire chains in\nTetzlaff, T. and Morrison, A. and Geisel, T. and Diesmann, M. (2004), Consequences of realistic network size on the stability of embedded synfire chains, Neurocomputing 58-60:117--121 .\nSec.4, 4th par.:\nHeterogeneity in synaptic potential sizes is not the optimal solution for this problem, because due to the large number of synapses a plausible variability in synaptic weights would largely average out (in contrast to a heteorgeneity in membrane time constants or thresholds).\nFast oscillatory modes can be dampened by distributions of delays not only for inhibitory but also excitatory connections. Of course, the delays of the connections between two consecutive synfire layers must be approximately identical (this may be justified by some learning rule based on spike timing). Connections between different pairs of layers can, however, have different delays.\nSec.5, 3rd par.:\n\"Such learning rules ... are dubbed STDP.\"\n\"...are dubbed spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP).\"\nFigure 2, left:\nWhat exactly is meant by \"A statistic based on the most prominent peaks in cross-correlations\"? Could you add a label to the x-axis here?\nThe article is highly readable and balanced. My comments below are only concerned with technical details of the dynamics.\nIn \"Activity in synfire chains\"\n\"It has been argued that the only stable mode of transmission is the synchronous mode (Abeles 1982, 1991). This was shown to be true theoretically (Hertz 1997), through numerical calculations (Diesmann et al. 1999), simulations (Abeles et al. 1993, Gewaltig et al. 2001, Hayon et al. 2004), and in the slice (Reyes 2003).\"\nI suggest to add sentences like the following here: \"A minimal number of neurons in each pool is required for stable propagation of synchronous spiking. Tetzlaff et al. (2002) showed that above a maximal number of neurons the ground state of asynchronous activity becomes unstable and synchronous activity emerges spontaneously.\"\nIn \"Memory capacity for synfire chains\"\n\"Even when only one synfire chain was embedded in such a balanced network, the network went into a mode of synchronous oscillations (Tetzlaff et al. 2002, Aviel et al. 2002).\"\nThe Tetzlaff 2002 reference is not accurate here. Replace by \"Even when only one synfire chain was embedded in such a balanced network stable propagation is challenged by modes of synchronous oscillations (Aviel et al. 2002, Mehring et al",

Built in the 1400s by prince Petru Mușat, Neamț reached its peak during the time of Ștefan cel Mare (Stephen the Great) Moldova’s greatest leader. Today, the fortress is home to a museum where visitors can learn about life in the 15th Century.\nCuejdel – The bigest natural dum lake in Romania\nCuejdel Lake was “born” on the river Cuejdel and is the biggest natural dam lake in Romania, located in the Stănișoara Mountains at 25 km from Piatra Neamț, in the village Gârcina.\nThe lake has its origins in a landfall that started in 1978 and ended in 1991. In the last stage took form the natural dam that blocked the entire valley and lead to the formation of the lake.\nThe Lake Izvorul Muntelui, also known as Lake Bicaz, is the largest artificial lake on the interior waters of Romania; it was created after the completion of a dam built on the Bistriţa River. The dam is located a few kilometers north of the town of Bicaz.\nThe dam was built between 1950 and 1960 and is used to generate hydroelectricity at the Bicaz-Stejaru hydro-plant. It has a height of 127 meters, a length of 435 meters, and a maximum width of 119 meters. The lake has a length of 40 kilometers, an area of 33 km² and a maximum volume of 1,250 million m³.\nThe lake is a popular tourist destination in the region, especially in summertime, when visitors can take the ferryboat from the Bicaz port for a short trip on the lake, enjoying the magnificent view of Mount Ceahlău on the west shore.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was regular ferry service between the Bicaz port and the villages on the lake shore.\nAt Potoci, a few kilometers north of the town of Bicaz, there is a biological research facility, equipped with a small submersible used for underwater explorations. The facility was visited by the marine biologist Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1984.\nPângărați and Vaduri\nFor several years, to our surprise, migratory birds that usually meet them in the Danube delta and lacustrine areas of southern Europe, settled Bistriţa lakes downstream of Spring Mountain, especially on lakes Pângăraţi and Vaduri.\nFormed in 1962, when it was constructed the hydropower plant with the same name, the lake is situated at an altitude of 325 meters, has an area of 240 hectares, the maximum width of 1 km, length of 3.2 km and a depth of about 15 meters. It is fed by the river Bistrița and brook Doamna, right affluent of the lake. Bâtca Doamnei Lake is located right at the edge of Piatra Neamț County, near the city’s ring road, at the exit towards Bicaz. Being an oasis of tranquility and recreation for residents and visitors of Piatra Neamț, the area offers a spectacular view of the Bistriţa Valley.\nThe oldest monastery in Neamț County that dates from the 14th Century.

      "For More Information:\nThe timeless AIS holiday classic receives a 2013 update. Sing along, won’t you?\n‘Tis the season to spread some holiday cheer, and of course, ‘tis always the season to spread aquatic invasive species (AIS) awareness. For the third year in a row, Wisconsin Sea Grant Aquatic Invasive Species Specialist Tim Campbell offers his AIS version of the classic “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” He’s made a few changes from previous editions but the core message of preventing the march of aquatic invasive species to protect Wisconsin waters remains the same.\nOn the twelfth day of Christmas, a canal brought to me – Canals have been a significant source of invasive species into the Great Lakes region. Canals can be an invasion pathway by opening previously unavailable habitat to a species (e.g. alewives, lamprey) or by allowing ships with AIS in their ballast to enter the Great Lakes (e.g. quagga mussels, spiny water flea). In fact, the pathway into the Great Lakes region for nearly all of the invasive species in this jingle can be easily tied to a canal. The only exception is the red swamp crayfish; it likely made its way into Wisconsin via an aquarium release.\nTwelve quaggas clogging – Quagga mussels are now the dominant invasive mussel in Lake Michigan. A congener (a member of the same genus) of zebra mussels, the quagga mussel can tolerate colder water and colonize soft substrates. These abilities have helped it colonize most of the benthic habitat in Lake Michigan. Just like zebra mussels, quagga mussels are quite effective at clogging water intake pipes and other infrastructure. Mitigating these impacts has cost Great Lakes residents millions of dollars.\n‘Leven gobies gobbling – The round goby is very fond of fish eggs. It is a known predator of lake sturgeon and lake trout eggs, and a swarm of round gobies can decimate a smallmouth bass nest. They can also consume zebra and quagga mussels which can cause toxins to move up the food chain, or bioaccumulate. The best ways to prevent future inland round goby invasions is to not use round goby as bait and to not move live fish. This will keep the goby’s gobbling ways from spreading to interior lakes.\nTen alewives dying – Alewives are one of the few invasive species that foul Great Lake’s beaches throughout the summer. Until the introduction of Pacific salmon, alewives died off in such great numbers that tractors were required to remove them from beaches. Salmon now do a great job controlling alewife numbers, but there are still alewife die-offs due to spawning and temperature related stresses.\nNine eggs in resting – The spiny waterflea and the fishhook waterflea produce tiny resting eggs that can survive extreme environmental conditions, so it is imperative to make sure that recreational equipment is cleaned to prevent spreading these invasive crustaceans. Luckily, their Wisconsin distribution is currently limited to Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, the Madison Lakes and a few other inland lakes.\nEight shrimp ‘a swarming – The bloody red shrimp is one of the Great Lakes more recently discovered ballast invaders. Bloody red shrimp swarms can be incredibly abundant, with swarms up to 1,500 individuals/square meter being documented. Their effects on the Great Lakes are largely unknown, but they may compete for food with young fish, and have been found in the diet of some fish in the Great Lakes. Regardless of the impacts, eight shrimp ‘a swarming is a huge underestimate.\nSeven carp and counting – There are seven species of non-native carp in the United States. There are the four collectively known as Asian carp (black, grass, silver and bighead), the common carp, the crucian carp, and last but not least, the Prussian carp (a wild version of the goldfish). While the current focus is on the silver and bighead carp, all of these carp cause problems one way or another. Hopefully, we won’t actually be counting any other carp species soon.\nSix lamprey leaping – This is some bad lamprey biology humor. Lampreys are actually poor jumpers, especially when compared to trout and salmon, so a small low-head obstacle or ledge can prevent lampreys from moving further upstream while other fish leap over the obstacle. Thus, physical barriers are one way managers are preventing lampreys from invading more streams in the Great Lakes basin.\nFIVE BOAT WASH STATIONS! – I wish we had five boat wash stations in Wisconsin! Actually, I prefer the term “decontamination station,” but since it had too many syllables I took some artistic license and used boat wash station instead. Boat washing can include any steps that clean a boat, but watercraft decontamination steps include AIS removal actions that go beyond draining water and removing vegetation. Oftentimes these steps involve the use of pressure washing equipment",
      "It was a painful outcome for the administrator of ARY Digital UK Limited (“ARY”) when he was found in breach of duty and liable to pay £743,750.\nThe case of Brewer and another (as joint liquidators of ARY Digital UK Ltd) v Iqbal  EWHC 182 (Ch) reminds office holders of the importance of understanding what assets they are selling, ensuring that correct marketing processes are employed and obtaining proper valuations.\nIt also highlights the importance of administrators exercising their own judgment and independence and of the duty to act in the best interest of creditors. Whilst this might sound obvious to an experienced office holder; the case does highlight the financial consequences of failing do this. Simply going through the motions with a marketing and sales process without proper consideration of the nature of the asset being sold, could have serious monetary consequences, as the administrator of ARY discovered.\nMr Iqbal was appointed administrator of ARY Digital UK Limited (“ARY”) on 19 May 2011. ARY was a television broadcaster. To facilitate broadcasts over the British Sky Broadcasting Limited (“SKY”) network, ARY had acquired Electronic Programming Guides (“EPG”). The EPGs meant that ARY content would be accessible from the SKY menu displaying current and upcoming television programmes.\nThere were 3 EPG television channels to be dealt with on Mr Iqbal’s appointment. Mr Iqbal already had interest from the directors of ARY to acquire them at £40,000 and asked Edwards Symmons to advertise the EPGs on their own website. Edward Symmons were told that, if no offers were forthcoming he wanted to proceed with a deal to directors 7 days later.\nThe description given on website was “…satellite broadcasting company serving UK and Europe. Three channels catering to a wide audience with entertainment, news and religious broadcasting”. The assets were listed under “plant and machinery”. The advertisement did not state that EPGs were for sale or identify what channel numbers were attached to the EPGs.\nAbsent any offers for the EPGs Edward Symmons were instructed to invoice the assets 1 week later notwithstanding Edward Symmons’ suggestion they allow more time for a potential purchaser to get in touch. It was clear Mr Iqbal was under pressure from the directors to sell and feared that SKY might “switch off” the channels rendering the assets worthless (a fear derived purely from what the directors had told him).\nMr Iqbal’s administration proposals were rejected by creditor and ARY went into liquidation. The liquidators brought proceedings against Mr Iqbal for breach of duty.\nThe liquidators focused on Mr Iqbal’s dealings with an associated purchaser, noted that he failed to obtain a proper valuation prior to selling the EPGs, accepted a value provided by the directors or their accountant on their behalf and allowed a very short marketing time to suit the directors. The liquidators argued that Mr Iqbal was effectively acting for the purchaser and not the creditors.\nActing without due care and skill\nAt court, Mr Iqbal accepted he did not have much knowledge of SIP 16 and SIP 13 and that he did not keep much by way of written record. He accepted he had no knowledge of EPGs or their value and had no steer from the company accounts since they did not attribute a value for the EPGs.\nThe court concluded that Mr Iqbal had failed to understand the nature of EPGs and their true value which in consequence led to a failure to properly market the EPGs. There was no evidence of attempting to negotiate the price with the directors. The advertisement itself made no reference to the EPGs or channel numbers that were for sale (certain channel numbers should attract a premium or semi-premium price), there was no mention of audience numbers. EPGs were listed under “Plant and Machinery” and would not have targeted the best audience. The sale proceeded notwithstanding advice to give the assets more time to sell. The assets were not exposed to a specialist market (and it was clear there were experts in this field who could have been identified and approached) and not for an adequate time. The buyer had been protected by not advertising all the information that would have been reasonable to do. He failed to make adequate enquires of the agent used and did not try to seek out anyone more specialist.\nThe court found he acted without due care and skill.\nBreach of duty\nMr Iqbal made a conscious decision to exclude the name of ARY and its location when advertising its assets for sale and overall he failed to act with “single-minded” loyalty to the creditors of ARY. He chose not to expose the EPGs to the market (even if it was to a non-specialist market) for a reasonable time. His concern the EPGs would be “switched off” was only a perceived risk because the directors told him it was. The court heard expert evidence that SKY in fact operated a ",
      "Life After A Brain Injury: 'I'm Not Terrified Of Death Anymore'\nTim Page is no longer afraid of death. That's the one positive takeaway for him after surviving a traumatic brain injury.\nLast year, the University of Southern California music and journalism professor — who was also a child prodigy filmmaker, Pulitzer-winning critic, person with Asperger's and father of three — collapsed at a train station. He woke up in an ambulance speeding to the hospital. He's still recovering, still fumbling a bit with the jigsaw pieces of a life a now a little more puzzling, a little more amazing.\nPage, 61, has a new book out, Thomson: The State of Music & Other Writings,which is the second volume of works he's edited by the American critic and composer Virgil Thomson. Over at NPR Music, we had a long discussion about Thomson, his legacy and the state of classical music criticism in America. I should mention that Page was my mentor while he was classical music critic for The Washington Post. He was unflagging in his support of a greenhorn stringer. For two years, I read my reviews to him over the phone before I filed them. Then there were the \"Brewtorials,\" our meetings at pubs to mark up reviews with red pens.\nAs you can read in our conversation, Tim has lost none of his generous spirit. This account has been edited for length and clarity.\nYou recently wrote a harrowing and sometimes humorous account of your continuing recovery from brain surgery you had just 13 months ago. First, may I ask how you are doing?\nWell, thank you, and I'm really glad you mentioned that piece because I am quite proud of it. [In July 2015] I was in New London, Conn., waiting for a train to Washington, when all of a sudden I woke up in the back of an ambulance. It was as if I blinked my eyes and I was in another world. And I didn't even remember who I was or anything like that. It was like being just knocked off the face of the Earth.\nI had what is called an acute subdural hematoma with transhemispheric tentorial something or other. And it turns out that the kind I had kills outright something like three-quarters of the people who have it. The people who survive manage to, some of them, come back as I did, but it's a tiny amount. And a lot of survivors are permanently disabled. I was fortunate enough that I wasn't seriously damaged intellectually.\nI don't happen to be religious at all, but I do believe that if you come so close to death and are fortunate enough to be spared, you have a duty to tell what it was like, especially if you are a writer. So many people have had these things over the centuries and, you know, very few people live to tell.\nWell I must say it's a beautiful essay about being dealt a pretty bad hand. I imagine that it was, without sounding too clichéd, cathartic to write it. I'm wondering also if you've heard from others who have suffered a TBI?\nYes, I've had a tremendous response to it. I got a lovely letter from the wife of a gentleman who had a terrible traumatic brain injury. And he couldn't write to me himself, but she wrote a letter telling me that he was grateful. I wouldn't call it cathartic to write; it was a real bitch to write. It was the hardest thing I ever wrote. But I will say it was cathartic to finish it.\nAnother result of your injury is how you fully embraced Facebook, and how much love you got back from your legions of Facebook friends throughout your ordeal.\nIt was vastly important. It was a chance for me to keep in touch with people. When people would write me something or send a compliment I could just reach out and press \"like,\" which acknowledged my gratitude. And then, every week or so, I would work hard on a paragraph that told my friends what had happened and what was happening now. I'm addicted to it. But in part because it's really all I can do now without a lot of work. I'm not very good talking on the phone now, at least most of the day.\nI think a lot of people feel like Facebook is a good place to be validated and, frankly, to be loved.\nI don't care that much about validation these days. I care about communication. I do care a lot about being loved and hearing from people who matter to me. But that's not really the main reason I do it. Look, I've been a writer and I've been a radio guy. With Facebook, I can put up a gorgeous recording that I love and let others play that for themselves. Or I can grump about something and get really smart responses from all over the world. So it's for me it's a blast — a great way for a near-recluse to",
      "Peer Reviewed Publications\nHanke et al., Nature Communications.\nAbstract: SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.\nVolz et al., Nature.\nAbstract: The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing shows an unprecedentedly rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during Autumn 2020, suggesting a selective advantage. We find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Time-varying reproduction numbers for the VOC and cocirculating lineages were estimated using SGTF and genomic data. The best supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number.\nVolz et al., Cell\nAbstract: Global dispersal and increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant D614G are suggestive of a selective advantage but may also be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection. Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with higher viral load and younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth and size of 614G phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of this variant.\nCustódio et al., Nature Communications.\nAbstract: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies constitute a key short-to-medium term approach to tackle COVID-19. However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC50 of 0.6 µg/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed an unusual conformation of the spike where two RBDs are in the ‘up’ ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly",
      "Buy Here Pay Here Dealers: Separating the Facts from the Fiction\nIf you are stuck in a financial rut you aren’t sure how to get out of, it can be easy to cling on to any sliver of available hope. In the same way that buyers in bad financial shape can easily buy into “easy” ways out, it can be just as tempting to believe the negativity that centers around some of these solutions. Having bad credit isn’t the same as making one bad choice behind closed doors – bad credit will not only stay with you for a long period of time, it can also lead to added stress and unnecessary headache. Rather than get down on yourself about your current state of financial affairs, realize that there is a real and worthwhile way out of the hole of debt you find yourself buried inside. The answer to your credit score shame lies with a loan known as buy here pay here in Dayton. Whether you have heard of this particular loan structure before, or are learning of it for the very first time today, there are some aspects of this process that need to be addressed.\nClearing the Air: Buy Here Pay Here Loans\nIt can be easy to get excited about the potential of digging yourself out of debt, and reversing your negative credit score in the process. It can also be easy to become deflated when your hopes are crushed by uninformed online articles, or by well-meaning friends and family members. Buy here pay here loans have received their fair share of negative PR over the years, some of which was deserved, but most of which was not. Today, we are determined to officially clear away the fog that has unjustly plagued this type of automotive loan for decades. Too many good candidates that would have benefitted from a buy here pay here loan opted not to take advantage of the opportunity based on rumors and the mistakes of past dealerships. If you are on the fence about securing a reputable buy here pay here loan from a reliable dealership, then continue reading through the false rumors and accusations that have given this particular automotive loan a bad name.\n- FICTION – Buy here pay here loans send drivers further into debt.\n- FACT – This first rumor is one of the most prevalent in the subprime lending industry. The bad reputation for buy here pay here loans was the result of poor national and statewide regulations. This lack of governance lead many unethical dealerships down a path of deceit, taking advantage of buyers in need of help. A reputable dealership with a buy here pay here loan program will not only help you get into the car you need, it will also report your payments to the proper national credit bureaus so that your credit score actually improves. Before you actually take a dealership up on a buy here pay here loan amount, be sure to head online and read about its reputation from actual sub-prime customers.\n- FICTION – Buy here pay here loans are impossible to pay off.\n- FACT – This second ugly rumor was born out of the discontent of drivers who ended up having to pay a higher than average interest rate on their vehicles. Buy here pay here loans are not like traditional car loans, and because of the high risk associated with this type of lending structure, dealerships require a higher rate of interest to keep themselves protected. Today, dealerships that offer buy here pay here loans are regulated in terms of the amount of interest that can be charged, which serves to better protect everyone involved. A good buy here pay here dealership will sit down and discuss your budget, income, and what you can realistically pay each month toward a car.\n- FICTION – Buy here pay here loans set you up to fail.\n- FACT – This is another point in which higher than average interest rates come into play. The other area to consider is the true market value of the vehicle you are considering to buy via a buy here pay here loan. Be sure that the dealer you are working with features the true fair market value on all of its available models within the program, so that you know that the amount asked is in line with what the car is actually worth. While some buy here pay here dealers have been known to scheme unsuspecting individuals into an outrageous loan that will certainly not be sustainable long term, the majority of these dealerships are truly interested in seeing their customers succeed.\n- FICTION – Buy here pay here dealers require a down payment close to the total cost of the car, and take monthly payments solely for their own selfish gain.\n- FACT – Back when the very first buy here pay here dealerships opened their doors in the 1970s this was, unfortunately, a common practice. Without any real government regulations, dealerships took advantage of the fact that they had “creative freedom” when it came to structuring in-house car loans. While this rumor may have been true once upon a time, the truth is it hasn’t been part of buy here pay here dealerships for several years.\n- FICTION – Buy here pay here dealerships will repossess and sell the same car five times within a single year.\n- FACT – As awful as it",
      "In Texas, Community Property Laws apply in determining the Property Distributions to a wife and husband. This system is employed to divide the property fairly between the divorcing couple.\nWhat is Separate Property? Texas Family Law Code, FAM 3.001: A spouse’s separate property consists of:\nThe property owned or claimed by the spouse before marriage\nThe property acquired by the spouse during marriage by gift, devise, or descent\nThe recovery for personal injuries sustained by spouse during marriage, except any recovery for loss of earning capacity during marriage.\nThe terms “owned and claimed” as used in the Texas Family Code means that where the right to the property accrued before marriage the property would be separate. Inception of title occurs when a party first has a right of claim to the property by virtue of which title is finally vested. The existence or nonexistence of the marriage at the time of incipiency of the right of which title finally vests determines whether property is community or separate. Inception of title occurs when a party first has a right of claim to the property.\nUnder Texas Constitution, Art. XVI, Section 15, separate property is defined as all property, both real and personal, of a spouse owned or claimed before marriage, and that acquired afterward by gift, devise or descent, shall be the separate property of that spouse; and laws shall be passed more clearly defining the rights of the spouses, in relation to separate and community property; provided that persons about to marry and spouses, without the intention to defraud pre-existing creditors, may by written instrument from time to time partition between themselves all or part of their property, then existing or to be acquired, or exchange between themselves the community interest of one spouse or future spouse in any property for the community interest of the other spouse or future spouse in other community property then existing or to be acquired, whereupon the portion or interest set aside to each spouse shall be and constitute a part of the separate property and estate of such spouse or future spouse; spouses may also from time to time, by written instrument, agree between themselves that the income or property from all or part of the separate property then owned or which thereafter might be acquired by only one of them, shall be the separate property of that spouse; if one spouse makes a gift of property to the other that gift is presumed to include all income or property which might arise from that gift of property; and spouses may agree in writing that all or part of the separate property owned by either or both of them shall be the spouses’ community property.\nWhat Is Community Property? Texas Family Law Code, FAM 3.002: Community property consists of the property, other than separate property, acquired by either spouse during the marriage.\nTexas Family Code, Section 3.003 states that all property possessed by either spouse during or at the dissolution of the marriage is presumed to be community property and that the degree of proof necessary to establish that property is separate property, rather than community property, is clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is defined as that measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. If property cannot be proved clearly and convincingly to be separate property, then it is deemed to be community property.\nThe Texas Family Code, Section 7.002, deals with quasi-community property and requires a court divide property wherever the property is situated, if 1) the property was acquired by either spouse while domiciled in another state and the property would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property had been domiciled in Texas at the time of acquisition; or 2) property was acquired by either spouse in exchange for real or personal property and that property would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property so exchanged had been domiciled in Texas at the time of the acquisition.\nWhat about Property Acquired during Marriage? Property in which inception of title occurs during marriage is community property unless it is acquired in one of the following manner, in which it becomes separate property of the acquiring spouse:\nBy devise or descent\nBy a partition or exchange agreement or premarital agreement specifying that the asset is separate\nAs income from separate property made separate as a result of a gift, a premarital agreement or a partition and exchange agreement\nIn exchange for other separate property\nAs recovery for personal injuries sustained by the spouse during marriage, except any recovery for loss of earning capacity during marriage.\nDuring a divorce, it is important that both parties know what type of property is involved in the divorce and what is separate and community property. This knowledge may determine or influence what each party will receive at the end of the settlement.\nYou are getting divorced! After the emotional decision is made you must address financial situations impacting the family breakup.\nWhat are the major financial pitfalls of a divorce? Are you prepared to stay on top of all financial problems and decisions in this divorce to strive for a financial win-win situation?\nWhere’s",
      "Belize: more than just a blue hole\nBelize is best known for its Blue Hole, a paradisiacal looking hole in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. One that has already adorned many travel guides and postcards. The funny thing is that I had a fantastic trip in Belize without seeing the Blue Hole. There is so much more to see, to do, to undertake than I thought as a semi-seasoned traveller. Belize even stands at the forefront of the eco-tourism movement. Little did I know. I would like to take you to this fantastic island. Or no, wait a minute, Belize is not an island. First let us help clear up this misunderstanding.\nBelize is not an island\nBelize is located in Central America, south of Mexico, east of Guatemala, and north of Honduras. Belize has hundreds of amazing offshore islands but is not an island. Its location on the eastern coast of Central America, however, is perfectly situated between intriguing dense jungle to the west and the Belize Barrier reef on the east. Mayan ruins are scattered all over this beautiful green jungle, which makes it a perfect destination for adventure seekers, culture enthusiasts, animal aficionados and yes even beach bums.\nBelize for the adventure seeker\nGoing into the Mayan underworld at Actun Tunichil Muknal, or the “Cave of the Stone Sepulchre” is an unforgettable experience. Literally: you cannot take any camera into the caves, so you will have a completely zen, smartphone and camera free day. The rules to enter the cave are very strict and you can only sign up for this tour with an experienced guide.\nAfter a walk through the jungle and carefully taking in the instructions you follow the guide into the dark cave while swimming and clambering, without touching all the beautiful stalagmites and stalagtites. In this cave they have found Mayan pots, vases and even human bones. You will once again receive important instructions to walk around here in order to not damage anything. Whether this has been a place of ritual sacrifice is not completely clear, but it is certainly exciting and magical. National Geographic rated it as the number 1 Sacred Cave in the world!\nWe did this amazing tour with Maya Walk tours. I would consider the caving to be moderate, but some passages are quite narrow, so please keep that in mind. The ATM cave is situated near San Ignacio in the Cayo District. There are other tour operates offering this activity there as well.\nThe exclusive nature of the ATM visit and the way these tours are accurately organized, made it a very unique experience. I was pleasantly surprised by their recommendations to bring reusable cups and bottles to ensure responsible travel. While diving a bit deeper into this subject I came across some interesting information on Belize and its ecotourism. No other country in the world can show a greater percentage of its land mass dedicated to natural reserves, parks, and preserves. Belize also invests in community-based tourism projects to support locals in rural areas. Of course, it is up to the tourist to play a crucial role in this eco-tourism story!\nBelize for the culture enthusiast\nThere is nothing so magical as walking through a pristine jungle and seeing beautiful Maya temples rise up over all the trees. Belize is the ideal place to get in touch with the ancient Mayan culture.\nThe Mayan civilization originated about 2,000 years before Christ and extended over Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico. Most cities experienced their heyday between 250 and 900 AD and were well known for their development in art, culture, architecture, astronomy ... What remains of that ancient culture now, are beautiful ruins in the jungles.\nSome of the most interesting Mayan sites in Belize are: Lamanai, Altun Ha, Caracol, Xunantunich and many more. We had the chance to visit Caracol.\nCaracol is situated in the Cayo District and is the largest known Mayan ruins in Belize. It is a bit harder to reach than the other ones, but definitely worth the 2-hour drive because of the scenery of the Pine Ridge Mountains and the feeling of remoteness once you get there.\nIt is a grand site with amazing temples that you can climb to enjoy the fantastic view of the forest reserve.\nTip: don't forget to stop at the Big Rock Falls waterfall or Rio on Pools for a refreshing dip and/or an Instagrammable photo op!\nWe also did this tour with Maya Walk Tours.\nBelize for the Nature Lover\nPlacencia is the perfect base to visit some of Belize's most interesting nature reserves. Once a sleepy fishing village now a peninsula with a mix of luxurious hotels and more low-key beach resorts. One common factor: palm-lined sandy beaches. A dream!\nSpotting jaguars...or not\nCockcomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is recognized internationally as the world’s first jaguar reserve. The area consists of more than 50.000",

      "Every Single Article Written by N - All 1343\nI got to sit down with Saints Row IV at E3 a few weeks back, but let’s face it: half an hour with an open-world game, much less a Saints Row game, isn’t much of a preview. Now in the quiet hamlet of our sunny Phoenix, far from the pressure of appointment windows and crammed exhibition halls, Deep Silver let me play with a far more extended version of that E3 demo to really get a feel on how this game is so much different than its predecessors.\nRussell is back in the game for real as we tackle his questions about our MANEATER Kickstarter, which Cody and I covered largely in the last show. He needles us with inquiries, yo. Then we follow up with a check in with our favorite old school PC developers and where they’ve wound up over the years. Stay tuned for adventure!\nIt’s 12:14PM. I click on the link in Maki Naro’s tweet, which leads me to his Kickstarter for a new comic series called Sufficiently Remarkable and the total is still $0. Naro is a final-three contestant in Penny Arcade’s Strip Search, a web series in which a dozen artists from around the world (although all American; one living in Montreal) competed for a $15,000 prize and an opportunity to be embedded with the massive Penny Arcade empire. Naro didn’t win, settling for an anecdotal third place, but now two weeks after the show’s finale, he’s highlighting a very important trait in a successful Kickstarter campaign: the necessity for exposure.\nBecause we’re celebrating Don Mattrick’s departure to Zynga today, I decided to dig down the rabbit hole because I’d always wondered where a guy like Mattrick comes from. In 1983, game developers Don Mattrick and Jeff Sember of Distinctive Software, Inc. went on CBC’s Front Page Challenge to explain their trade as Canada’s first video game developers. The panelists’ inquiries reveal a strange, naive era in which video games are still rare things to be dissected and understood. Let’s take a deeper dive, shall we?\nWho called it? We called it. I’ve been asking for Don Mattrick’s head longer than Microsoft’s investors have been asking for Ballmer’s and it looks like now, three weeks after he took the stage in Los Angeles, he’s departing for distant seas. But who is this Mattrick? We’ve talked about him before, but let’s see if we can’t nail down his contributions to gaming down, for better or worse.\nOh my. Whether it’s Paula Deen being a racist or one of the Ellison kids resurrecting the Terminator series for no reason, it’s gotta be the FEZ trio making up an agenda as they go along, rambling about everything from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s, uh, second coming, or the collapse of Instagram. Keith is still sadly on vacation, but our Del Taco-powered charades are plenty to keep you busy!\nWhen Sprint downgraded, then eliminated their Sprint Premier program, I knew it was time to move on. Other carriers had done the same thing with their rewards programs for people who paid higher rates for their plans, this much I understood, but it eliminated one of the biggest reasons I stayed with Sprint once the smartphone war began to settle in for real. In reality, I’d still pay a bit more per month so I could get a new phone every year at retail price and not have to pay an Early Termination Fee to switch. The carriers will have to cede a little, but will they bite? To the point: why would you need a new phone every year, anyway?\nThe quantities are beginning to be known, the “primaries” are over and this November frames an election that will dictate the capital of home console entertainment for longer than four years.

      "The following lecture on the Ebonics controversy was delivered by Helen Halyard, the assistant national secretary of the Socialist Equality Party in the United States, in a series of appearances on college campuses in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Halyard spoke to student audiences at Wayne State University, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and the University of Pennsylvania in March and April.\nThe main issue in the dispute over Ebonics is not language, but perspective. Those who base themselves on the permanence of capitalism are seizing upon racial differences in order to make them a barrier to unifying working people in the struggle to change society. They promote the conception that the great division in American society is between black, white and Hispanic or American born and foreign born.\nThe great unmentionable in American politics is that we live in a society that is becoming more and more polarized socially. Everything in this country is described in racial and ethnic terms, rather than from the standpoint of class.\nAs socialists we reject these false views and call on black, white, Hispanic and immigrant workers to unite in the struggle for social equality. Having a decent and secure job, a comfortable retirement, quality education, health care and housing ought to be considered as social rights and must be provided to everyone, regardless of race or ethnic background.\nWe see human progress as bound up with the fight to unify workers internationally for the purpose of reorganizing society on the basis of human need, not profit. As socialists we have a firm belief in the ability of mankind to overcome backwardness and oppression.\nThroughout history the greatest minds have held the perspective that mankind could overcome the conditions of poverty and hunger and fight for a just and humane society. As Marxists, it is to this goal that we subscribe.\nOpposing this view are those who promote nationalist solutions within the framework of the capitalist profit system. In Ireland it is Protestant against Catholic, in Sri Lanka the Tamils against the Sinhalese, in Canada French-speaking against English-speaking and in America, black against white, native born against immigrant.\nWhy is Ebonics being promoted and who will benefit from it?\nEbonics, a term coined in 1973 by Robert L. Williams, was promoted by a narrow layer of black separatists. Until recently the very term was unknown outside of academia. Ebonics is the offshoot of a broader outlook called Afrocentrism, an ideology which holds that identity is based solely on skin color and that blacks have a unique culture, history and even language.\nWhat is revealed in the debate over Ebonics is the gulf between an upper middle class black layer and the more impoverished minority youth. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that there are not sincere teachers and liberals who may be seeking different methods of instruction out of a genuine desire to overcome the educational problems facing black youth. But such motives cannot be ascribed to the originators of this proposal.\nThe very same school board that adopted the resolution on Ebonics and claims to be concerned about the low test scores of black youth was engaged last year in a vicious strike-breaking operation against the school teachers.\nThe strike raised the demand that class sizes be reduced through a cut in administrative funding. Oakland spends a higher percentage of its budget on administration than most other large districts in the state. The Bay Area average is 15.7 percent, while Oakland spends 19.1 percent.\nThe school board rejected the teachers' demands. Instead, it formed a task force ostensibly to discuss troubling performance levels among black students. With barely any discussion, the school board passed the recommendation from the task force that Ebonics be recognized as the language of black students.\nThe action of the Oakland school board served to further foment racial division, at the same time that the basic needs of students remain unresolved. The main beneficiaries of this resolution are not the youth, but a small privileged layer of blacks.\n\"Ebonics\" instruction has spread to a number of California schools. It has already become a multimillion-dollar affair, creating comfortable careers for academic theorists, lavishly paid consultants and textbook writers.\nThis divergence of interests becomes even clearer when we examine another case in which Ebonics became a central issue. In 1977, four families who lived in a housing project in Ann Arbor, Michigan, sued the local school district for failing to meet the needs of low-income children and misplacing them in special education classes.\nOne of the parents recalled in a recent press interview: \"The teachers didn't put as much quality time into making sure our children learned. The assumption was that we were poor and we didn't care.\" What these parents demanded was equality; that their children be afforded the same standard of education that children from wealthier parts of Ann Arbor were receiving.\nThe lawyers representing them, however, brought in research provided by Dr. Geneva Smitherman, a proponent of Ebonics, who claimed that the problem was the failure of teachers to recognize \"black English.\"\nWhen the case went to court, the charges related",
      "Secret dossier proves Mugabe stealing election\nPublished in The Mail on Sunday (July 21st, 2013)\nDamning top-secret intelligence documents that expose Robert Mugabe’s plans to rig the forthcoming election in Zimbabwe and crush his political rivals have been handed to The Mail on Sunday.\nThe dossier reveals in astonishing detail how Mugabe is plotting to steal millions of votes with massive and systematic ballot-rigging combined with widespread intimidation by party thugs.\nHis tactics, along with details of massive funding from named British, Chinese and African backers, are disclosed in highly confidential papers written for his closest aides.\nThey were obtained from intelligence sources who risked their lives to expose the covert campaign to keep 89-year-old Mugabe and his brutal military cabal in power.\nThe documents explain how ‘unfavourable voting outcomes’ for the ruling Zanu-PF party will be ‘countered’ for a multi-million-pound fee to an Israeli company that has been helping the dictator for a decade.\nThey also show how Mugabe’s desperate bid to retain power in the nation he has ravaged during 33 years of repressive misrule is being aided by the Chinese government, fellow African dictators and secretive diamond mining firms.\nOminously, the leaked papers reveal the recruitment of armed militia and talk of the need for ‘disciplinary action to enemy leaders,’ saying the use of ‘absolute neutralisation of the enemy…is recommended when necessary.’\nPeter Hain, the former Africa minister and campaigner against blood diamonds, said: ‘This confirms our worst fears about democracy being prostituted in Zimbabwe.’\nThe South African-raised MP added: ‘The Government and EU cannot turn a blind eye to such abuses when democracy is being destroyed and the opposition muted in such a manner.’\nThe documents, prepared for the head of Zimbabwe’s highly feared Central Intelligence Organisation and the Joint Operational Command (JOC), the body that oversees state security, contain a number of alarming disclosures.\n- Nikuv International Projects, an Israeli firm, is being paid $13 million (£8.5 million) to manipulate voter registration, counter ‘unfavourable’ results and ‘neutralise’ opposition votes.\n- The Chinese government is helping with ballot rigging, advising on voter intimidation and providing jamming equipment to silence independent radio stations.\n- Already, 45,534 youths have been trained and deployed across the country in armed militia to ‘stem resistance’, with another 7,343 undergoing training and ‘mass reorientation classes’ to be ready three days before polling.\n- Security forces are adamant that six Zanu-PF moderates ‘must be STOPPED’ from standing. One of the named politicians, Edward Chindori-Chininga, died last month in a suspicious car crash. His family say it was an assassination.\n- Funding for the covert campaign is coming from controversial diamond companies, the presidents of two African countries and prominent business figures from Britain, China and Zimbabwe.\n- Millions of dollars are being directed towards leaders of southern African countries providing independent election monitors to ‘drum up support for poll credibility before, during and after elections’.\nThe Mail on Sunday was passed the dossier by intelligence figures frustrated with the barbarity and rigid discipline of Mugabe’s Marxist-influenced regime. ‘There are lots of us who hate the way things are done by the old guard,’ said one.\nThis source, a senior official among the estimated 300,000 spies in Zimbabwe, was clearly nervous when we met in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. Security forces are caught up in factional feuding among the generals and politicians plotting to succeed Mugabe.\nThe election in ten days’ time is Mugabe’s last roll of the dice after three decades in power during which time his regime has wrecked the economy, ruined key public services, helped halve life expectancy and driven about one in six Zimbabweans into exile.\nThe previous poll in 2008 was held against an appalling backdrop of poverty and starvation caused by the second-worst case of hyper-inflation in history, peaking at 231 million per cent. Shops had no food, hospitals closed and Aids was rife.\nThe opposition Movement For Democratic Change won by 20 per cent. But after Mugabe’s goons started to slaughter their rivals, foreign diplomats forced the creation of an uncomfortable coalition with the despot back as president and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister. After introducing the dollar as currency, the economy stabilised – yet close to nine in ten people remain unemployed.\nThe leaked papers show a clear strategy led by security forces in alliance with the Chinese communist party and Nikuv to ‘neutralise hostile votes in urban areas’ where MDC support is highest.\nAmong the tactics are under-registering voters aged under 35 and over-registering older people, who are more likely to vote for Mugabe. They also discuss ‘parallel registration through party offices with strict advice from Nikuv International for statistical",
      "If insanity is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result, then Americans may be insane.\nWe dump poisonous carbon emissions into the atmosphere even though we know they are killing our planet. Then we repeat.\nSome of us even think that’s okay. As the rain forest burns, the arctic melts, and ocean temperatures rise, climate change denial remains an acceptably mainstream political position in America. That’s also insane.\nClimate change deniers want you to pretend the science isn’t real. Although that’s misguided, the deniers do have one valid point: reliance on science is killing us.\nWe need to learn from our shamanic and native forebearers. We need a paradigm shift in the way we think about our relationship with Mother Earth. We need to rethink the priorities we attach to our relationships with science and with our planet.\nAlbert Einstein said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” Science has certainly made lives better in so many ways, but science is an edgy sword. Our love affair with science through the ages has caused a profound disconnect with our planet. We love what science can do for us, but now we know that industrialization brought about by scientific achievement is killing us.\nWe must renounce what we hold dear in order to save ourselves.\nLet’s start with industrialization. We love the wonders of modern technology, the factories that mass produce things that temporarily make our lives easier, the plastics, the cars. Do we not see that scientific progress has contributed mightily to the destruction of our planet?\nIn olden times, before humanity placed faith in science and industry, mankind had a nurturing relationship with Mother Earth. We loved our planet and it loved us back.\nFor millennia, prehistoric mankind treated our planet with reverence. We treated the rivers and forests with dignity. We must return to that mental place. The planet and the human race are one. We exhale, the Amazon forests inhale. We are connected to the planet with every breath we take.\nThe natives of our land knew in their hearts that our planet is sacred. Shamanic believers, generation to generation, worshiped Mother Earth. In turn, Mother Earth provided sustenance. The natural love which they imbued in our rivers, our air, the trees, and the stones was with a faith in Nature and God and the Universe.\nThen, the scientific/industrial revolution happened. As Naomi Klein points out in her fine new book, On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal, until around the year 1600, our European ancestors viewed the planet as a living organism we now call Mother Earth. With the onset of the scientific revolution, Klein says, “the metaphor changed.”\nJules Cashford, in her remarkable essay, “Gaia and the Anima Mundi” (which can be found in Spiritual Ecology: The Cry of the Earth, second edition, September 2016), posits that the Greeks of 500 B.C. believed that Gaia, with a capital G, Mother Goddess of Earth, was also gaia with a small g, or earth. They were the same; gaia was Gaia; earth was Earth. To Westerners, the planet was a goddess way back in 500 B.C.\nOur native brothers and sisters recognized the sacredness of our planet back before recorded history, and they still do. North American Natives were pushed from their land by European capitalist expansionists. Winona LaDuke’s essay, “In The Time Of Sacred Places,” calls out the newcomers for naming native sacred sites for mortal men who are on this planet a short time (Mount McKinley, Pikes Peak, Mount Rainier). She tells us that “to name sacred mountain spirits after mortal men, who blow through for just a few decades, is to denude relationship.” We must re-nude ourselves and get back to the Garden.\nThe onset of the industrial revolution shifted our focus from the divinity of the planet to a toy, a plaything that is to be used and abused for our pleasure.\nThe industrial revolution brought us great new technology over the centuries—trains, planes, automobiles. Electricity and gasoline gave us power to continue to advance and explore. As our needs for more grew, we needed more gas, we needed more oil, we needed more coal, we became harder to satisfy. The human condition required more toys.\nWe have lost our connection to Mother Earth. How important is it that we can travel from Los Angeles to Paris in just 11 hours when we are perilously close to being unable to survive on our planet for longer than a few more generations? Do we really need to get to Paris in 11 hours? Shall we save our planet instead? Greta Thunberg took a zero-emission boat from Europe to New York and managed fine.\nMother Earth has treated us well throughout human history because we have treated her well. Until the industrial/scientific revolution, there was a symb",

      "Soloists Susan Graham, William Berger, Cyndia Sieden, Jill Grove, Celine Ricci, Brian Thorsett, and the Philharmonia Chorale perform\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 2009, 8 PM\nThrough more than 20 years as its music director, Nicholas McGegan has established the San Francisco-based Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra as the leading period performance band in America – and at the forefront of the “historical” movement worldwide. McGegan and the orchestra return to Walt Disney Concert Hall to kick off the 2009/10 Baroque Variations series and celebrate one of England’s greatest composers in a special all-Purcell program.\nAcclaimed soloist Susan Graham, mezzo-soprano, making her Walt Disney Concert Hall debut, joins William Berger, baritone; Cyndia Sieden, soprano; Jill Grove, contralto; Celine Ricci, soprano; Brian Thorsett, tenor, the Philharmonia Chorale, McGegan and the orchestra, for a performance of Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. The program also includes O sing unto the Lord a new song, Chacony in G minor, Hear my prayer, O Lord, and Suite from Abdelazer or The Moor’s Revenge.\nSusan Graham, one of the world's foremost stars of opera and recital, is a compelling and versatile singing actress. She received both a Grammy nomination and France's Maria Callas award for her portrayal of Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. A New York Times review stated, \"Ms. Graham…paints Dido as passionate from the start. ‘When I am laid in earth' is as wrenching an account as you'll find on disc.\" Baritone William Berger has been declared \"...one of the best of our younger baritones\" by Gramophone Magazine, and California-born soprano Cyndia Sieden is renowned for her extraordinary vocal facility and interpretations of baroque, classical and contemporary repertoire. American mezzo-soprano Jill Grove, recognized for her distinctive dramatic mezzo-soprano and passionate artistry, has won critical raves throughout America and Europe for her distinguished portrayals of the heroines of German and Italian opera. Young French-Italian soprano Céline Ricci was named one of the opera’s promising new talents by Opernwelt magazine. She already has an impressive discography and has made numerous appearances in Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. The Los Angeles Times has hailed Ricci as “a knockout…” Tenor Brian Thorsett fosters a stylistically diversified repertoire which has taken him to numerous U.S. concert halls.\nCritically acclaimed for its brilliant sound, robust energy, and sensitive delivery of the text, the Philharmonia Chorale was formed to provide a vocal complement whose fluency in the stylistic language of the Baroque period matched that of Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. The 24 Chorale members are professional singers with distinguished solo and ensemble experience.\n17th century composer Henry Purcell is regarded as England's greatest Baroque composer. His work was greatly influenced by the theater and the Chapel Royal, where he began singing as a small child and later took appointments maintaining instruments, playing organ, and serving four monarchs. O sing unto the Lord a new song, a complete setting of Psalm 96, shows the lighter side of Purcell’s church music. Dating from 1683, it would have been sung with Charles II in attendance, and reflects his taste for good tunes with toe-tapping rhythms. Though nothing is known about its origin or purpose, the Chacony probably dates from roughly the same time (early 1680s) as Hear my prayer, O Lord, and shares some of its harmonic adventurousness. By the time Purcell was 30, he was the biggest musical star in the London theater scene. Two of his eight theater projects in the year he died were revivals of plays by Aphra Behn, who has been called the first female professional writer in the English language. Behn wrote Abdelazer or The Moor’s Revenge, the story of a captive Moorish prince who seduces the queen of Spain and then kills her and the king, in 1676. Dido and Aeneas, Purcell’s only opera, has long been regarded as the purest example of his genius with its profusion of good tunes, sheer concentration of memorable moments, and mastery of the work’s vast expressive composition.\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic Association presents music from the 17th through early 18th centuries in its Baroque Variations series. The 2009/10 season series continues with: Handel’s Messiah on December 15, 2009; Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra on February 3",
      "Gravitational waves from colliding black holes were first observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) instruments in 2015. Building on these efforts on the ground, an international group of scientists is working to develop a space-based gravitational wave observatory called the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Dr. Thorpe developed instrumentation used on LISA.\nTech Briefs: Could you tell me about the LISA Pathfinder project.\n(James) Ira Thorpe: It is basically a technology demonstrator for a future mission we’d like to do. However, it’s important to note that there are two different missions, one of which is happening now and is nearly complete; the other is just getting started.\nTech Briefs: When did the project begin and what was its goal?\nThorpe: For quite a long time, people have been thinking about building a gravitational wave detector in space. It paralleled the development of gravitational detectors on the ground, which led to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Those instruments made the historic first discovery of gravitational waves back in 2015. On June 1 of this year, they announced their third observation of gravitational waves generated by a merger of two black holes.\nThe concept of gravitational waves dates back to Einstein, nearly a hundred years ago. The idea of building an instrument to measure them didn’t come along until sometime in the 1950s or early 1960s however. By the mid-1970s people started thinking about sending a detector into space. In the 80s and 90s, both in Europe and the U.S., there were serious studies as to what kind of spacecraft would be needed. In a short time, it was recognized that the scientific promise of such a project was enormous. By going into space, you can access parts of the gravitational wave spectrum, the millihertz frequency band, which can’t be accessed from the ground. The challenge is that a detector in space has to be really big and far from earth’s noise.\nThat was the motivation for doing it. People recognized that the science in that band was compelling, but the technology was going to be pretty difficult. In the early 2000s, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) initiated a joint project — the NASA project office was set up at Goddard in about 2001. They decided early on, that rather than do it all in one step, they’d do a technology demonstrator mission where they would build a single spacecraft that would validate some of the key unproven technologies before building the full three-spacecraft constellation. That single spacecraft became LISA Pathfinder, and was led by the ESA with NASA partnering.\nFor various reasons, it took longer than people were hoping for, but when LISA Pathfinder eventually flew in 2015 — it’s been operating since Dec 2015 — it’s worked fantastically. It has put us in a good position technically to build a space-based detector. LIGO making its first detections on the ground in September of that year after decades of effort, amped up interest from the public as well as the scientific community. So we’re in a really fantastic position for pushing this mission forward.\nTech Briefs: What has been validated with this first step?\nThorpe: There are two levels of validation that have been accomplished. One, which is a key technique for gravitational wave research, is called “drag free flight.” This has to do with the basics of detecting a gravitational wave. There are two things you need to do. One is to make some sort of reference object that feels only the forces of gravity but is not affected by non-gravitational forces, which can mask the subtle effects of the gravitational wave. The way we do this on the ground is to build incredibly complex mechanisms to suspend mirrors by thin glass wires. You put in a vacuum system and then have the heroic engineering job of isolating the test mass from vibrations on the ground, while still supporting it.\nIn space, we have the advantage of being in zero gravity — we can just let the test mass go and feel only the gravity forces due to the gravitational wave. But if we just left it in open space, it would still be subject to forces such as solar radiation pressure and micro-meteorites. To solve this problem, we put the test masses inside, but not touching, the spacecraft. Once we get to operational orbit, we release a test mass inside a small cavity within the spacecraft. The test mass is a gold-platinum alloy cube that measures about 4 cm on each side and weighs about two kilograms. Since the object resides within an electrostatic housing, but is not touching its walls, it is in perfect free flight. The spacecraft literally flies around the cube — so if there’s an external force like a solar wind or a micrometeorite, the spacecraft senses a drift",
      "Your law firm is like a baby going through the different stages it has to go through in order to be an adult.\nAt each stage the child needs to learn specific lessons to mature through each stage through adulthood.\nWhen you first start your law firm you have to take those baby steps (the basic necessities) first, otherwise it’s like you are a newborn trying to be an adult. At each stage there is a different lever you can use to complete that stage and move on to the next one.\nThese decisions can change. You just need to start with something.\nIn this stage you’ll access the lever of time. Make the most of your time and learn to use it well. All these things take time and now is when you need to master it.\nHow do you hire that first employee when you just start? First make sure you’re not starting your own law firm right out of law school. So far all you’ve done is read books. You need to actually practice law before you open your own firm. Start off working for someone and by a year or two you’ll have enough experience and you’ll have built up a good client base. This way you already start off with clients. Once you start your law firm you should hire someone (as long as you can afford it), so that the customer service level is maintained at what your clients are used to.\nAlthough lawyers see hiring employees as an expense, it’s really a necessary investment. You should really hire your first employee as soon as possible because it’s just not feasible to get everything done when you are doing everything on your own.\nIt’s not even like you have to lay out a lot of money right then and there. You’re paying your employee...\nI am a firm believer that people shouldn’t hire based on skill, rather they should hire based on personality, motivation, and passion. Skills can be taught, but it’s the personality and character that’s almost impossible to teach.\nFirst and foremost when you hire it should be for the emotional intelligence and core values. It’s so expensive and painful to hire and train someone who ends up not showing up or quitting after a short time. When you hire from the human side of things, you will see a world of a difference in the employees you hire.\nMoney motivates to a certain point, but when you have a goal, a mission statement that someone is passionate about then that will be a greater motivator to them. They won’t mind being paid less at first.\nEarlier on in my career, when I worked in the IT industry, I was working for a technology company that served schools. I was a salesman and in the few busy months of my first year we made 2 million dollars in sales. That happened without any planning, so imagine what we could have done if we did have a plan. We spent half a day coming up with a plan and the goal ended up being to make 30 million dollars in sales. It was a huge jump, but guess what? We did it. We went from 2 to 30 million and all it took was a little planning.\nThe only way we were able to achieve that goal was because we made a plan and arranged all the details beforehand.\nThe following three examples will show you different ways that planning is important:\n1. Let's say you want to travel from New York to Miami. You don’t know how to get there, but you know it takes 24 hours. If you just start driving and continue for 24 hours, you may end up on the opposite side of the country, near the west...\nEveryone has a different version of success. Once you define what success is to you, how will you get there? There are many routes to one goal, but some will be faster and more successful than the others. How do you find the most direct path?\nWe will find that path by using the book, The One Thing by Gary Keller with Jay Papasan. The topic of their book is focus, which is what my system thee 10x Differentiator is based on. Learning how to focus will help you achieve massive results in a shorter amount of time.\nTo Do Lists\nMost of us use to-do lists and many of us actually live by them. But there is something fundamentally wrong with them. To explain what is wrong with them, let me introduce you to the Pareto principle.\nPareto Principle - 80% of our output is achieved with 20% of our input\nBasically, it shows us that 80% of our input is wasted! 80% of our to-do lists are unnecessary and are just wasting our precious time and energy.\nEvery day, you get up early and put your heart and soul into your firm. You are the last one to leave each day and you sacrifice time with your family to try to make a difference.\nYou’re not unsuccessful, to the contrary, your peers think you’ve got it all figured out. However, you know the truth: the reason you started your law firm is",
      "Last night Ford unveiled their electric F-150 Lightning, heralding a major shift for Detroit and, if uptake is what they think it will be, the country. America loves trucks, and trucks burn fossil fuels. For the makers of America's bestselling vehicle (for over 40 years!) to release an electric version demonstrates confidence in the platform, and with it hopes for a future with less exhaust fumes.\nFord's designers did not have an easy task. Electric pickup startups like Rivian seem to be targeting wealthy Silicon Valley tech execs who can afford a flashy \"adventure vehicle\" to carry their carbon fiber kayaks to Santa Cruz; Ford must convince their base of contractors, farmers and blue-collar workers that the Lightning is a tough, capable and reliable workhorse that can do what their old F-150 did, but better.\nTo that end, \"It's designed to look like a truck,\" Ford says, \"because that's what it is.\" Only subtle badging, the uninterrupted light bar across the nose and the newly-styled taillights across the rear give any indication that this isn't an ordinary F-150. This was a wise choice, as was ensuring the 2,000-pound payload rating.\nCoupled with the raw power of the electric powertrain, which delivers a stunning 775 lb.-ft. of torque--enough to tow 10,000 pounds--the stats alone might be enough to convince an F-150 traditionalist to switch.\nEven still, the designers went further. \"Frunk\" is already a silly word and Ford didn't make things better by calling theirs a \"high-tech Mega Power Frunk,\" but there's no denying the utility of the Lightning's. It's got a 400-liter capacity and a 400-pound weight capacity. The front lip is bumper height, making it easier to haul heavy things in and out of it. It comes equipped with four electrical outlets providing 2.4 kilowatts--enough to run actual power tools--as well as two USB ports. It's watertight and features a drainhole in the bottom, so you can use the entire thing like a cooler and hose it out if needed.\nPower can also be extended to the rear, with a 9.6 kilowatt Onboard Pro Power option that adds four more outlets to the bed, as well as a 240V outlet.\nThe Lightning of course offers a 360 camera, which as I wrote in our review of the GMC Denali removes the single largest UX hassle of driving a large truck. Parking, squeezing through tight turns while reversing and maneuvering around property obstacles are all a breeze with a 360 camera.\nAnd speaking of 360, the Lightning's got 360-degree lighting around the truck, which should come in handy for working late or when you've dropped something while unloading the truck.\nAnother neat trick is the sensor-equipped Onboard Scale. This tells you, via the gigantic 12-inch touchscreen on the dash, just how much the cargo you're carrying weighs. This not only helps the system calculate how much actual range you've got left, but lets you ensure you're not exceeding the payload, or prevents you from getting ripped off at the scrap metal yard.\nSpeaking of range, the base Lightning comes with a battery good for 230 miles on a full charge, with an option to step up to a 300-miler.\nAnd speaking of batteries, that may provide the true killer app for the Lightning, the one that makes people eager to get one. It was not lost on Ford when they unwittingly made national news for being the brand of truck used to power people's homes during the blackouts in Texas earlier this year. Ford is thus heavily advertising the abilities of the Lightning to act as a backup generator for your entire home. When it's plugged in to Ford's 80-amp charger and the lights go out, the Lightning can be set (automatically or manually) to start pumping juice the other way. Ford reckons at full charge it can power the average home for three days, or up to 10 if you ration. For those living along the Gulf Coast, Tornado Alley, Michigan or other blackout-prone areas, this feature may prove irresistible.\nWhich brings us to price. The \"commercial-oriented entry model\"--i.e., the work truck--starts at $39,974, while the mid-series XLT model starts at $52,974. A maxed-out version of the top-of-the-line Platinum will go for an insane $90,474.\nIf you qualify for the maximum federal tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle of $7,500, you'd be looking at 32 grand and change for a Lightning work truck. All things considered, that's startlingly cheap, though you'd",

Pundits expect it to follow suit for CES 2020, using the trade show as a platform to announce some new, more advanced 10nm CPUs. We could even see some fresh low-end and midrange CPUs were thrown into the mix and the launch of its Intel Xe GPUs, too.\nWhat to expect from LG at CES 2020?\nPress Conference: 8 a.m. PT on Monday, January 6\nWhat won’t LG announce at CES 2020?

      "Will your child's ADD get better if you homeschool?\nI'm no educational psychologist, but I've been homeschooling for sixteen years in three states. I often hear, \"Will homeschooling help ADD/ADHD?\" I've met hundreds of homeschooling families at conferences and workshops I've presented, I've answered hundreds of calls at a statewide homeschool phone line, and I've been a homeschool evaluator in Virginia for quite a few years now.\nOver and over again I've heard variations of this story --\nWhen I took my child out of school, his attention problems became manageable.\nLearning at home, my child no longer seems to have ADD.\nHomeschooling makes me realize that school did not fit my son, but that there is nothing wrong with him.\nHomeschooling lets my child work with his active side instead of against it.\nMy daughter's ADHD is still present, but since we took her out of school, it's no longer blocking her from learning.\nWe have stopped treating our child's ADD with medication since we started homeschooling, and she's still better than she was in school.\nThis sounds promising, right?\nBut it's not magic. The parents who observe such a change in their children also generally report actively shaping their homeschooling to address attention problems their child had in a school setting.\nBeginning to homeschool a child with ADD/ADHD*\nConsult your doctor if you are considering changing, reducing, or eliminating medication for ADD/ADHD. Some children remain on ADD medication while homeschooling. Some children take a reduced dosage or specially timed dosage. Others taper off or stop taking medication altogether. These medicines change the body chemistry, and abrupt changes of certain meds may be unhealthy or dangerous.\nWhat You Need to Know to Start Homeschooling\nThere are many opinions about whether children who are homeschooled need to take medicine for ADD/ADHD. Read what homeschooling parents are saying, and consider the pros and cons. You are your child's parent, and you get to decide what to do. However, keep in mind that this is a medical decision as well as an educational one.\nTake deschooling seriously. Children who have been in school with problems classified as ADD/ADHD have often been really stressed by the school experience. Read all you can about deschooling, explain it to your child, and commit to really letting it happen.\nDeschool yourself. If you are considering removing a child from school, or you have just begun homeschooling a child who was formerly in school and battling ADD/ADHD using school approaches, then you will need to deschool yourself. You have absorbed a lot about the things that an institution needed your child to do in order for that institution to try to educate him or her.\nNow you need to make discoveries about the learning situation your child needs to thrive. Learning at school and learning at home are not the same. Homeschooling parents frequently have to unlearn the defaults they learned as parents of school children. This is why we call it deschooling.\nIdeas for homeschooling a former school student with ADD/ADHD\nPlan your day according to rhythms rather than a schedule, especially at first. A helpful rhythm includes attention to alternating activities. For example, all day long, alternate indoor and outdoor activities. Alternate \"close work\" and \"big work\" -- such as alternating writing or drawing with building a tree house. Alternate a contemplative atmosphere (candles, tea, gentle music) with a purposely energetic atmosphere (rockin' music, dancing around the kitchen table, singing at the top of your lungs together).\nAt first, you may need more of the outdoor time, the \"big work\" time, and the high energy time. Keep those periods longer with much shorter periods of indoor, close, contemplative work. Follow your child's lead. If it takes four hours of running and playing for a child to be ready to read and draw for fifteen minutes, you can do that -- you're homeschooling.\nPay more attention to homeschooling style than curriculum. Many beginning homeschoolers have their heart set on finding the right curriculum, as if it will solve all educational problems. More likely, finding the right general approach to homeschooling for your child will be more important than curriculum in the early months and years of homeschooling a child who has been considered to have ADD/ADHD.\nRead about the different homeschooling methods and try the one that seems most like it will fit your whole child, not the one that seems like it would meet your immediate academic goals for your child.\nI know that sounds backwards -- but keep in mind that with ADD/ADHD children, learning will not take place, no matter how badly you want it to, if their energy and focus challenges are not addressed. If they have had a hard time in school, they now have to overcome that trauma. A curriculum that does not fit will only cause the trauma to be reinforced.\nFor most of these children, a homeschooling style that is more hands-on, interest-based, and project-oriented will be most",
      "What is your name and your current occupation?\nMy name is Chris Deboda. I’m currently a freelance concept artist/illustrator for the film and gaming industry.\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\nNone really. I’ve been a sales associate at a department store where the only crazy things there were a few of the customers on occasion. The real craziness didn’t begin until once I got into the industry.\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?\nI’m proud of almost all the projects I’ve been a part of in some form or another as long as I was able to learn and grow from each one. The most notable project I’ve been a part of to date would probably have to be the video game called “Red Dead Redemption” which has won an award or two.\nHow did you become interested in animation?\nGrowing up on 80’s cartoons, I’ve always been interested in animation ever since I could remember. I was also a huge fan of the old Warner Bros. Chuck Jones and Tex Avery shorts. And of course classic Disney Animation as well. It wasn’t until the 1990’s era of Disney Animation when I started seriously thinking about animation as a potential career path.\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\nOriginally born in North Carolina but I grew up in San Diego, CA. Always enjoyed drawing ever since I was a kid and ended up taking art classes throughout high school, and college. I remember, as a teen, writing and sending letters (before the emailing days) to all the big known studios in California requesting information on breaking into the business and what they would like to see in a portfolio. Eventually, I ended up graduating with an art/animation degree from Cal State Northridge. But upon graduating, I found that jobs in the film animation industry were hard to come by (not unlike today’s climate I suppose). So I looked towards the video game industry instead and worked my way up from there.\nWhat’s a typical day like for you with regards to your job?\nCurrently being a freelancer and working from home, my hours and schedule varies quite a bit. But in general, my working day mainly consists of alternating between checking emails and creating art based on notes from those emails. That said, I tend to be a night owl and whether I’m working on personal or professional artwork, most of my inspired, creative, and productive energy seem to occur at odd hours late into the night for some reason.\nWhat part of your job do you like best? Why?\nThe creative part of course. The early exploration sketching phase is a lot of fun since it allows you to dream a little bit and dig through your imagination.\nWhat part of your job do you like least? Why?\nDealing with tough and unrealistic deadlines. Also, working lots of overtime crunch hours for extended periods of time is not so fun. Lots of stress is involved when these things do occur.\nWhat kind of technology do you work with on a daily basis?\nI mostly use Photoshop on a Cintiq and a PC computer.\nWhat is the most difficult part for you about being in the business?\nThe instability part and not knowing where or when the next job and paycheck will be coming from. Makes it a little difficult to plan things in life.\nIn your travels, have you had any brushes with animation greatness?\nI’ve met quite a few great folks at various conventions, schools, art shows and even people from work. But I would have to say that the biggest event I’ve been to was the tribute event for Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston back in 2003. The biggest names in animation were all there under one roof but none bigger and greater of course then Frank and Ollie. Such an inspiring day that I remember like it was yesterday.\nDescribe a tough situation you had in life.\nAlthough not that uncommon in this business, but being a part of a couple of mass layoffs due to lack of work is always tough. Fortunately as it turns out, they end becoming a blessing in disguise each time they happen (for me at least), but it’s still a tough situation at the time nonetheless.\nAny side projects or you’re working on or hobbies you’d like to share details of?\nI’d like to join the self publishing bandwagon and get a personal art book out there some time soon. And who knows, maybe a graphic novel down the line as well.\nAny unusual talents or hobbies like tying a cherry stem with your tongue or metallurgy?\nI’m a bit ambidextrous, I guess. I’m predominantly right handed for most things but draw with my left. And I’m also a sports fan.\nIs there any advice you can give for an aspiring animation student or artist trying to break into the business?\nBe persistent, be humble, study and observe everything, draw every day, and of course go out and network. Surround yourself with other talented and passionate artists and maintain your enthusiasm towards drawing and creating",

      "Battlestations: Midway is one of the first truly tactical games to hit the Xbox 360. It puts you in control of planes or ships and you must out wit or outsmart your opponent to take the victory. It’s a lot different from your average FPS where the rule of ‘spray and pray’ comes to mind, in this you can’t simply spray and pray but instead you use precision assaults, evasive manoeuvres, flanking moves, you name it, to either sink your target or shoot them down. It is a welcome break from games like Prey, Gears of War and Rainbow Six, but the real question being is the game good enough to keep us off our beloved FPS titles?\nNow the first you will need to do is go through the games rather in-depth tutorial mode. The main reasons people don’t like this game is because they don’t understand how to play it and I would most certainly recommend everyone goes through the tutorial before going into battle. It will take you through everything from operating your map and ordering your planes, through to attacking with your various vehicles and setting up formations. Sure you can pick up most of the controls while going through the single player but when online you’ll be like lamb to the slaughter if you don’t go through the Training mode.\nSo firstly the story of the game, you in control of Henry Walker who like most soldiers has to earn his way to the top, through victories. You start out in a little PT boat with a few torpedoes and a pea shooter, but you will slowly but surely rise through the ranks and get to control destroyers, cruisers, battle barges and carriers.\nAt the beginning you’re only allowed to use a single unit and I must admit it gets a tad annoying after a while as your always wanting to change your ship so you can outflank and outsmart your opponent. Once you do finally get to control more units things get a lot more interesting, ordering each ship and plane to attack, defend, hold and retreat just feels so good you really feel like Admiral of the Navy.\nYou yourself can of course control your own unit and everyone has their favourites, whether it’s the submarines, battle barges or planes. Saying that, what about the rest of your fleet, well you can order them to move or attack via the map page (which is on the back button). The map is pretty simple to use but again in the tutorial there’s a whole section on it which is definitely worth having a look at.\nSometimes the ships don’t do what you tell them and don’t attack or go where you told them to go, it’s annoying but simply re-ordering them to their objective usually fixes the problem. On the whole the map is your greatest friend, without it you WILL have a massacre on your hands and learning how to use it is of the up most importance if you wish to succeed in the game.\nAs well as the campaign mode there is also various unit missions for the submarines, ships and planes. Some of the missions are pretty damn difficult and you usually find yourself outgunned, outnumbered and outclassed, but if you do manage to finish all the levels you will truly be an awesome player which will help you out on what is by far this games greatest aspect, online play.\nOnline is where this game truly excels. It hosts up to 8 player matches, four on four, in which you must use teamwork to win games which can last for hours on end. You must choose either the Japanese with the Soryu and there Kamikaze bred Zero pilots, or there’s the yanks with the Yorktown, Wildcats, Renown’s and dauntless bombers. Not forgetting though that you will only get a certain amount of units, so while you may have a Carrier with the countless planes, your Allies will have the submarines or battle barges, so you must use all the units together to do well online. If it’s a one on one match then you will control everything and that really is good fun, the only problem with the online section of the game is that in a few 4 on 4 matches the lag is just unbearable. Quitters like usual, ruin this game at times, as do Hosts who can’t take losing and so close the entire lobby.\nOn the whole though the game is amazing fun online, especially if you have a few mates on your team, as communication is key. Lag is present at times but despite that the games multiplayer online makes up for its various flaws.\nGraphically the game is ok in parts and not so good in others. The ships and planes do look like they could be improved, but even so they are unbelievably detailed and the little seamen on the decks walking around just look awesome. The water also looks pretty damn good (why is the Xbox 360 so obsessed with its water effects) as do the clouds of all things. Sadly the little islands and also the airfield runways look very dull and boring. The texture has obviously been",

      "See below for a selection of case studies and scientific publications.\nSensor insole for measuring temporal variables and vertical force during sprinting\nJ Sports Engineering and Technology 1–6\nTemporal variables and vertical ground reaction force have been used as measures characterizing sprinting. A recently developed wireless pressure sensor insole (sensor insole) could be useful for monitoring sprinting in terms of temporal variables and vertical ground reaction force during training sessions.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the concurrent validity of the sensor insole for measuring temporal and vertical force variables during sprinting. One athlete performed five 50-m sprints, and the step-to-step vertical ground reaction force and plantar pressure were simultaneously measured by a long-force platform system (reference device) and the sensor insole, respectively. The temporal and vertical ground reaction force variables were calculated using signals from both devices, and a comparison was made between values obtained with both devices for 125 steps analyzed. The percentage bias, 95% limits of agreement, and Bland– Altman plots showed low agreement with the reference device for all variables except for step frequency. For the vertical ground reaction force variables, the sensor insole underestimated the values (218.9 to 248.3%) compared to the force platform.\nWhile support time and time to maximal vertical force from the foot strike were overestimated by the sensor insole (54.668.0% and 94.2623.2%), flight time was underestimated (248.2615.0%). Moreover, t-test revealed the significant difference in all variables between the sensor insole and force platform, except for step frequency. The bias for step frequency (0.467.5%) was small. However, there was heteroscedasticity for all variables. The results from this study demonstrate that a wireless pressure sensor insole is generally not valid to measure the temporal and vertical force variables during sprinting. Thus, using the examined sensor insole for monitoring sprinting characteristics is not recommended at this time.\nPostural Control as Predictor of Lower Extremity Injuries in Male Youth Soccer Players\nAmerican Journal of Men s Health 13(1), February 2019\nYouth soccer players bear a particular high risk of injury due to a potential lack on an adequate level of physical fitness, which is considered as an intrinsic risk factor for injuries (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005). Typically, lower extremity injuries occur in situations characterised by rapid changes of direction and single-leg landing, often with the player getting out of balance.\nThe ability to maintain balance has received more attention in injury prediction as increased variation in postural stability is associated with an altered neuromuscular control strategy and may lead to injuries (Murphy, Connolly, & Beynnon, 2003). However, prospective research is rare, and the relation between insufficient postural stability and injury is still unclear. Typically, force platform serve as gold-standard for the analysis of postural control. For in-field diagnosis, wearable sensor insoles provide an alternative diagnostic tool. However, less empirical evidence on sensor insoles for injury prediction is given. Furthermore, little research exists on balance measures as potential intrinsic injury risk factor in youth soccer.\nThe aim of this study was therefore to investigate the predictive value of the postural control measured by wearable sensor insoles in male youth soccer players.\nOptimization of a foot model for the evaluation of the injury risk during cutting movements in football\nProcedia Engineering 60 ( 2013 ) 325 – 330\nCutting movements in football (soccer) induce high loads on the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. The injury risk is affected by the shoe-surface interaction. For the evaluation of different influencing factors of this interaction the TrakTester, a custom-made device, was used. To obtain significant results from testing ACL loading a realistic plantar pressure distribution in the shoe is required. Using the TrakTester several cutting movements were carried out using two different foot models with the resultant plantar pressure analysed with three different systems: The original foot model with Parotec insoles (24 integrated sensors; Paromed GmbH, Markt Neubeuern, Germany), the modified version of this foot model with Pedar-X insoles (99 sensors; novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) and the inflexible model was surveyed with the OpenGo science system (13 sensors, Moticon, Munich, Germany). For the inflexible model distinct angles between the lower leg and the surface were adjusted and the obtained plantar pressure distributions were analyzed.\nAs the first version showed high pressures in the arch region, it was modified to reduce the load in this area. A second inflexible model induced the pressure in the heel and forefoot region. For various angles similar plantar pressure distributions were obtained.

In the north it is surrounded by mountains, the Montes de Málaga (part of the Baetic Cordillera) lying in the southern base of the Axarquía hills, and two rivers, the Guadalmedina ? the historic center is located on its left bank ? and the Guadalhorce, which flows west of the city into the Mediterranean.\nThe oldest architectural remains in the city are the walls of the Phoenician city, which are visible in the cellar of the Museo Picasso Málaga.\nThe Roman theatre of Málaga, which dates from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered in 1951.19\nThe Moors left posterity the dominating presence of the Castle of Gibralfaro, which is connected to the Alcazaba, the lower fortress and royal residence. Both were built during the Taifa period (11th century) and extended during the Nasrid period (13th and 14th centuries). The Alcazaba stands on a hill within the city. Originally, it defended the city from the incursions of pirates. Later, in the 11th century, it was completely rebuilt by the Hammudid dynasty.20 Occupying the eastern hillside that rises from the sea and overlooks the city, the Alcazaba was surrounded by palms and pine trees.\nWeather in Andalusia\nAndalusia sits at a latitude between 36° and 38° 44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a Mediterranean climate, with dry summers influenced by the Azores High, but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures.2728 In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. In a mere 50 km (31 mi) one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of Mulhacén. Andalusia also includes both the dry Tabernas Desert in the province of Almería and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park in the province of Cádiz, which experiences Spain's greatest rainfall.29303132\nAnnual rainfall in the Sierra de Grazalema has been measured as high as 4,346 millimetres (171.1 in) in 1963, the highest ever recorded for any location in Iberia.33 Andalusia is also home to the driest place in continental Europe, the Cabo de Gata, with only 117 millimetres (4.6 in) of rain per year.\nIn general, as one goes from west to east, away from the Atlantic, there is less precipitation.33 \"Wet Andalusia\" includes most of the highest points in the region, above all the Sierra de Grazalema but also the Serranía de Ronda in western Málaga. The valley of the Guadalquivir has moderate rainfall. The Tabernas Desert in Almería, Europe's only true desert, has less than 75 days with any measurable precipitation, and some particular places in the desert have as few as 50 such days. Much of \"dry Andalusia\" has more than 300 \"sunny\" days a year.\nThe average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over 16 °C (61 °F). Averages in the cities range from 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) in Baeza to 19.1 °C (66.4 °F) in Almería.34 Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about 18 °C (64 °F). The coldest month is January when Granada at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of 6.4 °C (43.5 °F). The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F) for Andalusia as a whole. Córdoba is the hottest provincial capital, followed by Seville.35\nAn unforgettable taste of Spain\nMany travelers said that in Spain you can find everything what is needed to gather wonderful memories from the trip. It turns out that the country enchants all comers not only how their pleasantly warm climate, but also the cultural rich and",
      "Tropic Marine Centre Aquarium & Pond Products have been known for years in Europe (decades actually) as THE PREMIER fresh/marine aquarium as well as pond equipment company.\nAs well TMC is the authorized distributor for Quality Marine USA marine fish exports, who are the world leaders in ethical marine husbandry and healthy marine fish/reef invertebrates.\nIn speaking with many friends in the aquarium products/livestock industry, one thing that used to stand out about Tropic Marine Centre/Tropic Marin and that is this company has in the past backed the professionals such as the aquarium maintenance companies and high end aquarium speciality stores as well as selling via a high end professional distributor [Quality Marine USA].\nListening and responding to what these professionals asked. Also getting products (& livestock) that worked (and would be healthy as per livestock). Examples include the Tropic Marin Sea Salts, the AquaRay LED lights, and the Vecton UV Sterilizers.\nUnfortunately of late TMC is but a shell of the company they used to be when it comes to backing professionals. Thankfully their products are still quality, if you can get them, but their backing of professional retailers and distributors is a thing of the past.\nStill for the end consumer, one of TMCs positives over many other aquarium supply manufacturers is when there is a problem or warranty issue, TMC is still retailer based.\nThis means all returns are simply handled by the retailer purchased from, resulting in quick hassle free returns often with a new product. Compare this with manufacturer based returns that are becoming more common where by the buyer must send the product to the manufacturer, often waiting for a few weeks and often resulting in a refurbished replacement product!!\nAs well, speaking of warranty issues, TMC provides the longest warranty for their cutting edge, highest PUR LED lights with a 5 year fixture warranty; no other high end LED manufacturer even comes close with most only offering 1 year and a few offering two years\nTMC is on the cutting edge in many areas, especially LED Lights/Lighting.\nHere is the leading North American Retailer of their LEDs, whom I purchase from:\nPremium High PUR Aquarium LED Lights from AAP\nIn other areas of aquarium equipment, TMC has improved on products that already are well known; often for prices that are lower while providing a superior product.\nExamples here include the TMC Ozone Generator and Reverse Osmosis Aquarium Water Filter System\n- High performance, quality protein skimmer incorporating a patented venturi injection system which optimizes the perfect mixture of fine air bubbles and water and ensures intensive, efficient skimming and the removal of proteins and other harmful toxins (waste) from the aquarium.\n- Ozone Compatible; The V2 can be combined with an Ozone Generator for even more efficiency, in fact when used with an Ozone Generator this premium Venturi Skimmer can surpass any available Needle/Mesh Wheel Skimmer.\n- Unique “high purity ceramic” ozone cell design with microprocessor-controlled fan cooling for highly efficient and reliable operation\n- The TMC V2 Ozone Generator raises oxidizing levels within a Protein Skimmer or similar containment device for freshwater, this in turn helps to break down harmful waste products produced by fish, removing yellowing compounds and creating crystal clear water.\n- Simply the best RO System for Aquariums under $300!!\n- Three-stage, professional RO (reverse osmosis) system incorporating high quality components including a TDS Meter in Advanced Models.\n- 10 inch Sediment/Micron pre-filter cartridge which functions as a first stage filter, removing particles of up to 5 microns from the water while also protecting and prolonging the life of the RO membrane. This pre-filter is enclosed inside a transparent filter housing so it is easy to see when the filter needs to be changed.\n- 10 inch activated catalytic carbon block filter which offers the highly effective removal of contaminants such as chlorine/chloramines and colorants from the water.\nMost RO and RO/DI systems commonly sold via discounters and bulk reef suppliers use lower quality carbon that do not remove chloramines, unlike the catalytic carbon used in these premium TMC RO systems.\n- Highest quality Thin Film Composite (TFC) RO membrane, which removes contaminants such as heavy metals and hardness-forming minerals from the water, as well as a high percentage of nitrates and phosphates.\nThe other much more common type is the CTA, a.k.a. thecellulose triacetate membrane (sold by Dow), which is much less efficient, but also much less costly. These CTA membranes are used in most RO/DI systems commonly sold so as to meet price points, but the end result is the need to add DI canisters to the system which increase maintenance cost significantly.\n- Suggested use; In my commercial aquarium service business I found the use of a 32 gallon plastic trash can the best way to store RO water.\nWe would run the RO water directly through a small hole in the lid of the plastic trash can with a secondary tube",

      "Alimony, or spousal support, is sometimes conditioned upon the supported spouse remaining unmarried and single. In some states, cohabitation can influence a court to terminate alimony. Some states have laws that say cohabitation suggests alimony should be reduced or at least considered. In some alimony orders, cohabitation is one of the conditions on which alimony endso.\nIf a person suspects a former spouse of cohabiting with someone else, he may seek to reduce or stop alimony payments. However, states have different laws about the modification of alimony payments and the process can be complicated.\nCohabitation and Alimony in State Laws\nThe first thing to determine is if the state allows alimony to be modified. Not every state allows spousal support modification and cohabitation will have no effect on alimony in these states. Even if the state allows alimony to be modified, it is also possible that a person gave up this right during the divorce judgement. If this is the case, the person will have to make a motion to modify spousal support by requesting a hearing in divorce or family court.\nIn other states, there are laws that say cohabitation should decrease alimony. For example, in California the law says that a cohabitating spouse is presumed to have a decreased need for spousal support. Check the law in your state to find out whether there are laws related to cohabitation and alimony that might allow you to request a termination or a modification of your spousal support payments.\nContinue Making Spousal Support Payments\nIt is important to continue making timely alimony payments while waiting for a hearing date. Should a person fail to make the alimony payments, he can be found guilty of indirect contempt of civil court which requires another case before a different judge. However, if a person chooses to stop or reduce alimony payments before the hearing, he can demonstrate good faith by putting the payments in an interest-bearing savings account. He should still be prepared to pay the principal and interest to the former spouse, in addition to any attorney’s fees, if he loses at the hearing.\nThis is not recommended. It is always best to continue making payments until a court orders that spousal support be terminated. Even if spousal support is terminated or changed, it is difficult to know whether or how a court will deal with this problem prior to a hearing. Rather than stopping payments, consider requesting that the modification or termination be retroactive to the date the request for termination or modification was filed.\nCourt Views on Cohabitation\nStates have different definitions of what constitutes cohabitation and judges can also define cohabitation differently depending on the jurisdiction. A judge could find that a former spouse is indeed cohabiting if she has a serious romantic or intimate connection with her new partner. This can be proved if she and her new partner have their mail delivered to the same residential address, are on the same lease for the same rented residence, or regularly park their vehicles at the same residence.\nA judge may also find there is an instance of cohabitation if the former spouse and the new partner spend their free time and eat their meals at the same residential address, have or parent children together, and share bank accounts or other assets. Other factors in determining cohabitation include whether the former spouse and her partner make contributions to common household expenses or if their relationship is recognized in the community.\nIn some states, the law provides a definition of what it means to be cohabitating in a romantic partnership. A divorce attorney or family law attorney will know the laws in your state.\nThe facts regarding cohabitation are admitted into evidence during the alimony hearing. It may be enough to provide a declaration of the facts and evidence in documentary evidence you submit prior to the hearing, but declarations can sometimes be excluded from evidence so it is always best to come to the hearing prepared to tell the judge the facts and present any other evidence you may have about the cohabitation. In some states, evidence of cohabitation is enough to reduce or altogether stop alimony payments. However, other states require more evidence beyond cohabitation to justify reducing spousal support.\nIn these states, the court is likely to apply what is commonly known as an economic contribution test. The court will ask the former spouse if she has a permanent residence with her new partner or is involved in a relationship that is like a marriage. If the former spouse is receiving economic support from the new partner, or is using alimony payments to support the new partner, it is likely that the alimony payment will be reduced or eliminated.\nAppeals of Alimony Termination or Reduction\nIt is within the judge’s discretion to decide on the amount of payments to be reduced. Should this decision not be favorable, the person has the option to appeal. It is possible to move for a modification of spousal support more than once. Complications can arise if the former spouse breaks up with the new partner before the hearing comes to court, or if",

The difference is that when a person is injured they file a personal injury claim with the insurance company or the person or entity that caused the injury. If an out-of-court settlement is not reached on the injury claim, a personal injury lawsuit often needs to be filed with the court. Typically, lawsuits become necessary in cases where a fair settlement cannot be reached through negotiation with the at-fault party or their insurance company.

Personal injury law (also called tort law in legal circles) was created to protect you if you are injured, or if your property is harmed or destroyed such as in a motor vehicle accident because of someone else’s negligence or fault. Personal injury law is applied to car accidents to hold a negligent driver accountable. In a successful tort action, the negligent defendant is required to pay compensation to the person(s) they harmed; typically through either a car insurance settlement or an injury award made by a judge or jury.\nThere are many types of motor vehicle accident claims, including:\n- Car accidents\n- Pedestrian accidents\n- Truck accidents\n- Motorcycle accidents\n- Bicycle accidents\n- Boat accidents\n- ATV/dirt bike accidents\n- Reckless driver accidents\n- DUI accidents\n- Hit and run accidents\n- Uninsured motorist accidents\n- Distracted driver accidents\n- Failure to secure a load accidents\nFiling a Car Accident Lawsuit in Bellingham\nA car accident lawsuit is filed on behalf of an injured person to recover damages; it is used to hold a negligent party accountable for the injuries they caused. Accidents involving serious, permanent injuries often yield large settlements, but even with less serious injuries, accident victims can recover substantial damages for medical expenses and lost wages.\nNote that under Washington State Law, fault may be shared in certain accident cases between one or more negligent",
      "When you think of the World’s Championship Duck Calling Contest and the Wings Over the Prairie Festival, it’s hard to imagine the weekend without its Duck Gumbo Cook-off competition, but that wasn’t always the case.\nPrior to the 1980s, the festival included several events where food was a focal point. In the 1970s, there were a handful of Critter Suppers and the legendary Sportsman’s Dinner and Dance held the Friday night following Thanksgiving.\nIn 1980, the first Duck Gumbo Cook-off competition was put together, and since then, there has not been a festival without the free-spirited food contest. Because of COVID-19, the festival was canceled in 2020, making this year the 40th year for Duck Gumbo or just “Gumbo,” as it is commonly known.\n“The same crowd who would go to the Critter Supper started going to Gumbo because who doesn’t like gumbo in November?” Curtis Ahrens, Duck Gumbo Planning Committee chairperson, said.\nOver the years, there have been articles and stories written and broadcasted about the Duck Gumbo Cook-off. ESPN even covered the event at least one time and it’s a two-time finalist for a food-related event in the Arkansas Food Hall of Fame. If you are a resident of Stuttgart, you’ve either been to Duck Gumbo or have heard stories about what goes on in the big tent every year on the Saturday following Thanksgiving.\nAhrens has been a member of the gumbo planning committee since 2005, but his involvement with the event goes back to the 1980s, not long after the first Gumbo was held.\n“I was at the second Gumbo,” he said. “I don’t know why I wasn’t at the first Gumbo, but I wasn’t.”\nAhrens said even though the event was relatively new, it was crowded.\n“(Gumbo) started off with about 25 to 30 teams in the old armory. That’s all that would fit in the building,” he said. “(At the second Gumbo) there was a big crowd. It always had a big following.”\nHe said when the Duck Gumbo Cook-off replaced the Critter Supper, those who attended the supper began going to Gumbo.\n“There was always a really good crowd, even early on,” Ahrens said.\nAs time passed, the Sportsman’s Dinner and Dance fell by the wayside, and Duck Gumbo became the party of the festival.\nBut, it’s more than a party. It’s a serious competition, and the winner walks away with the title of World’s Best Duck Gumbo.\nWhen the event moved to the “big tent” in Producer’s Lot on North Park Ave., Ahrens said the event doubled the number of teams competing.\n“Now, we have 55 teams competing in the cook-off,” Ahrens said. “About half the teams are local and the other half are from all over the country.”\nIf you want to get in on the competition and see if you have what it takes to claim the title of “best gumbo,” you’ll have to get in line.\nRight now, there are about 30 names on the waiting list. Ahrens said some of those names have been waiting for 12 years or longer to get a spot in the competition. He said the competitors and the judges take their gumbo seriously.\n“The gumbo is blind judged,” Ahrens said. “No one knows you win until the number of the winner is announced. Then, the head cook will look to see if they are the winner.”\nDuring the judging process, twenty-five teams provide a judge for the competition. Upon arrival at Gumbo, the head cook is given an identification number. Each cup is labeled with the identification number, which only the lead cook is given and they keep it top secret until the winner’s number is announced.\n“The process is completely blind,” Ahrens said. “No one knows which team made what gumbo during the judging process.”\nThe team judges select the top 10 gumbo recipes, and then celebrity judges select the winner.\n“We’ve had radio and TV personalities come to judge the gumbo over the years,” Ahrens said.\nThe celebrity judges for this year’s gumbo have not been announced as of press time. Besides the judges, other celebrities have attended Gumbo as guests over the years. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have performed and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is a frequent visitor to Gumbo. The Budweiser Girls have even made an appearance.\nIn order to compete, each team must make three quarts of gumbo. Fifty percent of the meat in the recipe must be duck.\nTeams start cooking on Saturday at 10 a.m. and judging takes place at 3 p.m.\nWhile the gumbo takes center stage during the competition, the teams’ booths provide the atmosphere for the event.\n“We will have teams come",

      "The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) has pointed to a number of substantial factual mistakes regarding the Arab war on Israel contained in the New York Times’ Magazine guest columnist Roger Cohen’s profile of Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ( New York Times, July 8). In his article, Cohen claims the following:\n- “Livni brought out a map to make her point that a return to the precise 1967 lines — as U.N. resolutions and the Arab peace plan reiterated this year in Riyadh demand — was impractical.” —- The facts: No binding United Nations resolution calls for Israel’s complete withdrawal from all the territories conquered during the defensive 1967 Six Day War. The authoritative U.N. resolution on the war, United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSC) 242 calls only for “Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict” not “withdrawal from all the territories occupied” and only in the context of a negotiated peace agreement between Israel and the Arab belligerents in that war. This applies explicitly to Israeli armed forces, not to Israeli civilians. Unlike the so-called 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, UNSC 242 does not call for total Israeli withdrawal from these territories (which today would include Israeli civilians living there) and does not describe the disputed territories in question as “Arab territories.” In the words of former Supreme Court judge Arthur Goldberg who, as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. at the time, played a key role in the passage of UNSC 242, “The notable omissions [from the Resolution] are the words ‘the’ and ‘all.’ The significance of these omissions is vital to a proper understanding of Resolution 242. The Resolution, in essence, neither commands nor prohibits total Israeli withdrawal. Rather, it remits the extent and timing of any withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the parties to the conflict to negotiate.” By stating the opposite, Cohen is mistaken in law and fact and gravely misleading his readers.\n- Cohen quotes Palestinian Authority (PA) official Saeb Erekat claiming, “‘There are 70-percent-plus of Palestinians who go with the two-state solution, even if nearly 50 percent of Palestinians voted for Hamas. Those same people condemn suicide bombing. Look, negotiations are over. It’s time for decisions!’ He has a point.” —- The facts: Successive Palestinian polls indicate the opposite. A February 2007 Near East Consulting poll found that 75% of Palestinian Arabs do not think that Israel has a right to exist and that 70% of Palestinian Arabs support a one-state solution in which Jews would be a minority, not a two-state solution consisting of a Palestinian Arab state living peacefully alongside Israel. A September 2006 An-Najah University poll found that 61.3% of Palestinian Arabs support terrorist attacks upon Israeli civilians. A February 2006 Palestinian Center for Public Opinion poll showed that 83.3% of the Palestinian Arabs oppose dropping the legally and morally baseless so-called ‘right of return’ of refugees and their millions of descendants to Israel, and which is incompatible with Israel’s continued existence. Other polls have shown majority levels of Palestinian support for continued terrorism even if a Palestinian state were to be established.\n- “The 59-year-old battle for the same land of Zionist and Palestinian national movements … has been dragged into the wider crisis of Islamic civilization.” —- The facts: The Palestinian Arab war against Israel has always been a religiously-inspired war involving the surrounding Arab and Muslim world. The Palestinian Arab leader, Haj Amin el Husseini, who declared a holy war against the Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine, was close to the Muslim Brotherhood leader Hassan al-Banna, the spiritual father of Islamist thought and Al-Qaeda. The 1929 Husseini-inspired pogroms against Jews across the Mandate were engineered by a preparatory campaign of falsely alleging Jewish attacks upon Muslims and Muslim sites in Jerusalem. When the Palestinian leadership rejected the 1947 UN plan for a partition of the Mandate into Arab and Jewish states, the leadership of Al-Azhar, the leading Sunni Muslim religious institution in the Muslim world, declared a holy war on Israel even before it had been officially established. All Muslim states rejected the partition plan and surrounding Arab countries invaded to abort Jewish statehood.\n- “An Israel that wants to remain Jewish and democratic cannot also be despotic on occupied territories where Palestinian demography is against it … A Greater Israeli democracy will end up not being Jewish because there will be more Arabs in it than Jews.” —- The Facts: A recent study by the American-Israel Demographic Research Group (AIDRG) discloses that fertility rates for Israeli Jews stand at 2.75 per woman — the highest in the industrialized world — and, while not expected to rise further by 202",
      "What They Saw In Syria\nCandide, Cunégonde and their companions soon realised that their garden and their labour would not bring them the peace and happiness they desired for a long time. And so, they decided to leave Constantinople, the city they now referred to as their \"home\". Following his many thrilling adventures, Candide expected the worst. During each of his expeditions, life introduced him to new horrors and abominations that were incessantly piling up. He learnt his lesson despite the disapproval of his teacher Pangloss; he was unfortunately not in the best of all possible worlds. Candide wondered what more nonsense he could come across.\nThey travelled, and stopped several times, but they had one destination in mind, Syria. They all dreamed of its white sandy beaches, and of its azure waters, where the waves would slowly crash on the coast, forming thin strips of foam. And when their boat arrived on a deserted beach, they were not disappointed. Candide jumped out of the boat and landed on the fine, soft, wet sand. He could feel every tiny grain against his bare feet. The wind, just cool enough, rippled through his clothes, his hair and hugged his face. He felt free of all worries and the waves that came to lick his feet brought with them a wave of hope, which plunged him back into an inevitable optimism. The others joined him. They enjoyed the coast for the few remaining hours of sunshine, and as the sky turned red, they began to head towards the town of Banias.\nThey walked and reached the gates of the city. Candide had forgotten what had happened after he had retired from the Bulgarian army. Yet, he had seen the massacres they had committed when they were still only in Turkey. The images still haunted him: the women and children with their throats slit, the smoky ruins, and the men whose faces were no longer identifiable because of all the blood they had shed.\nHowever, the possibility that the soldiers had continued their war, that they might have slaughtered other women and children, had not even crossed his mind.\nAt the sight of the scene unfolding before him, all the emotions, the sensations that had overwhelmed him the first time, resurfaced and suddenly he felt paralysed. The whole of what had once been buildings was now nothing more than a mountain of stone covered with black blood that had dried under a blazing sun. The dust of the ruins had formed a permanent mist that blinded them. They continued a little further on to discover a hundred or perhaps two hundred bodies piled up. You could see the terror in the few eyes of the victims that were still open. Each corpse was missing at least an arm, a leg, an eye and often an ear, strangely enough. As usual, the Bulgarians had stolen and raped, massacred and ransacked everything. There was nothing left, no shadow of life. Candide and his partners were scared, frightened, horrified. With the smoke surrounding them, the sickening coppery smell of blood, and the ashes filling their lungs, they wanted only one thing: to leave.\nHopeless, they returned to their ship. Their minds drowned in the darkest and most sinister images, they hoisted their sails in the night as black as their nightmares.\nA few hours later, the sun rose and flooded the world with a warm, reassuring yellow light. Thoughts brightened, and the group saw the excitement of the journey return. So they decided to berth their boat on a dock of Greece.\nOnce again, the beaches and the turquoise sea charmed them. They travelled through the beautiful country and its equally dazzling Mediterranean landscapes. Even with the humid and heavy air that suffocated them, they did not stop. Every heavenly view left them wanting more. With sweat running down their temples, the friends landed in the small village of Sidirokastro.\nThey were walking through the narrow streets of a neighbourhood when large posters caught their attention. Thereon was written in large letters: \"THE BULGARIANS, OUR HEROES!’’. The old woman stopped in front of the sign, stunned: \"How dare they? These ratbags are all but heroes!’’. She walked towards the first passer-by and approached him: \"Sir, what do you think of the lies printed on this poster?’’. The old woman pointed an accusing finger at the sign behind her. The man answered in the most weary and indifferent tone possible: \"What is the problem? The Bulgarians, with their undeniable genius, are the reason for the peace that now reigns over our country. Can't you hear this delightful silence? No more of these cries of Abares who show up with their swords raised to kill everything that moves. The Bulgarians are without a doubt our saviours.’’. And with that, he continued on his way. The old woman turned around, outraged. In her tearful eyes the disbelief was obvious. The rest of the group was just as confused as she was. They continued on their way in",

      "Hispanic Heritage Month: 8 Ways to Get Involved with the Hispanic and Latinx Community in Boston\nThis year marks the 30th annual celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, but what is it exactly and how can you get involved? This list can get you ready to share Hispanic Heritage Month with others.\nWhat is Hispanic Heritage Month?\nHispanic Heritage Month originally started as a week-long celebration in 1968. Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan extended it to last an entire month. September 15 marks the beginning of this month-long commemoration that aims to recognize and celebrate the contributions that Hispanic and Latinxs have made in the United States.\nWhy was this date chosen?\nSeptember 15 was chosen as the kickoff date for Hispanic Heritage Month because it marks the anniversary of the independence of five Latin American countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras.\nWhat is the difference between Hispanic, Latinx, and Spanish?\nIt is important to keep in mind that, while some individuals may identify as belonging to more than one group, these denominations are not interchangeable and do not always intersect.\nHispanic: originating from Spanish-speaking countries.\nLatinx: refers to individuals from Latin American countries.\nSpanish: refers to individuals born in Spain (Spanish nationality).\nAn individual may identify as both Latinx and Hispanic (such as someone from Venezuela, for example). However, an individual can be Latinx but not Hispanic (as is the case with Brazilians). The best way to approach the subject is to ask individuals about which group(s) they identify with.\nWhat is the significance of Hispanic Heritage Month today?\nAcknowledging the contributions made by the Hispanic and Latinx community in the United States is very important. Particularly now when openly anti-immigrant sentiments are so prevalent in politics and popular media. Hispanic Heritage Month should not be reduced to a hashtag, positive PR or a pandering effort. It should be seized as an opportunity to examine the challenges facing Hispanic and Latinxs as well as building bridges between communities.\nHispanic and Latino communities have helped drive socio-economic growth in Boston, a city where 35% of immigrants come from Latin America. However, Massachusetts was named the worst state for Latinxs by The Bay State Banner after recent data from 24/7 Wall Street claimed that Massachusetts is the worst state in the nation when it comes to economic and social disparities between white and Hispanic residents. In this article Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal points out how limited resources create an opportunity gap for Latinxs that contributes to these disparities. Discriminatory lending practices and rising rents, as well as networking opportunities and hiring practices, mean that “Latinos are often under-resourced and under-networked.”\nHow can I support Hispanic and Latinxs during Hispanic Heritage Month?\nOne way to show support to the Hispanic and Latinx community is by promoting organizations and businesses run by Hispanics or Latinxs. Interacting with the Hispanic and Latinx community can help increase mutual understanding and appreciation. Additionally, endorsing these types of ventures and events ensures that the Hispanic and Latinx communities will continue to grow in Massachusetts.\nHere is a list of places where you can support Hispanic and Latinx in Boston:\nSeptember 27 to September 30\n“The Boston Latino International Film Festival has been committed to using the power of film to break stereotypes, bring cultures and communities together and reveal the complex issues that affect the Latinx community in the United States and other Spanish-speaking countries.”\n2. Yo Soy Lola\nYo Soy LOLA (Latinas Orgullosas de Las Artes) is a movement to reclaim the Latina narrative through artistic platforms, including a yearly thought-provoking multimedia experience showcasing Latinas in the arts via spoken word, acting, dance, music, film, and more. Their October 5 Gala will feature a night of Latin music, dance, and a full hour production.\nSeptember 19 and September 26\nThe Latinx Queer Film Series is a film series that highlights the diverse lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) Latinx people. This event is presented by IBA (Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción) and The Theater Offensive.\n4.

      "Noah was an obedient servant of God in the Old Testament who found favor with God amidst a sinful world. He is most well-known for building an ark that preserved himself and his family, as well as representatives of every land animal, from a great flood that God unleashed in judgment upon the earth.\nWhat Is the Meaning of Noah?\nThe name Noah means “rest.” It derives from the Hebrew נוח (nuah), to rest. The name could also mean \"comfort.\" It may seem ironic because the story of Noah involves neither of these things. After all, God floods the earth, and that doesn't seem like a whole lot of rest or comfort for its inhabitants. But perhaps this name can remind us of the feeling that Noah's family likely felt when at last the Flood waters receded and that God comforted them with a rainbow, reminding them that he would never flood the entire earth again.\nWhat Is the Story of Noah?\nWhen God saw how wicked and corrupt man had become, He regretted creating them and decided to destroy all of mankind (Genesis 6:7). However, God gave Noah favor because he saw that he was righteous (Genesis 6:8). God commanded Noah to build an ark to house and preserve his family, as well as every male and female species of land animal, from His punishment of a flood on the earth (Genesis 6:14-21).\nThe rain fell and the floodwaters rose around the ark for 40 days, however, Noah and the other inhabitants remained safe (Genesis 7:17-18).\nAfter a dove that Noah had sent out returned with an olive leaf (Genesis 8:11), these sole survivors of the flood disembarked where God blessed Noah and his children, encouraging them to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 9:1). He also commanded them to not eat flesh which still has blood in it (Genesis 9:4), nor to spill the lifeblood of their fellow man (Genesis 9:5-6).\nAdditionally, God made a covenant with Noah and his sons, promising to never destroy them, their descendants, nor any living creatures through a flood ever again (Genesis 9:9-11). As a token of His covenant, God set a rainbow in the clouds to serve as a reminder of His pledge to all living creatures on earth (Genesis 9:12-17).\nWhat Else Does the Bible Say about Noah?\nNoah is first mentioned in the Bible when his father Lamech predicted the upcoming destruction of the earth and Noah’s role in restoring mankind: “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed.” (Genesis 5:29).\nNoah had unwavering faith and godly fear to build an ark when God warned him about a flood he had not yet seen:\n“By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith, he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith” (Hebrews 11:7).\nNoah is numbered as being amongst three of the most righteous men in the book of Ezekiel, alongside Job, and Daniel:\n“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness” (Ezekiel 14:20).\nInteresting Facts about Noah\n- Noah is the tenth generation descendant of Adam; Noah’s grandfather was Methuselah, who is the oldest man recorded in the Bible (Genesis 5:27). He lived to be 969 years old. Some have said that Methuselah died in the flood, but most likely he died right before the events had happened. In either case, we don't have enough details from Scripture to know.\n- Noah himself was 500 years old when he had his sons Japheth, Shem, and Ham; At the time of the flood, Noah was 600 years old (Genesis 7:6).\n- Upon stepping on dry land after the flood, Noah first built an altar to God (Genesis 8:20); Noah planted the first vineyard after the flood, and he is the first drunk recorded in the Bible (Genesis 9:20-21).\n- When Noah’s youngest son Ham found his father drunk and naked in his tent, he went and told his brothers, instead of covering him. For this transgression, Noah cursed Ham’s son Canaan to be the lowliest of servants to his brethren (Genesis 9:22-26); After the flood, Noah lived another 350 years, dying at the age of 950 years.\nBible Symbols from the Story of Noah\n1.

Numerous specify a minimum land size and require a percentage of land to be personal open space. A subdivided block usually requires car to access along with the existing house and at least one car area for each two-bedroom home (2 for 3 bed rooms).\nA perfect property for subdivision has the existing residence near the front border and plenty of side area. Corner blocks make for simpler car access and have actually the added advantage of giving the new house a street frontage.\nFor blocks that are less than ideal, subdivision business in Heidelberg West have know-how in working out methods of dealing with the guidelines. Town planning experience suggests he can tell in a matter of minutes whether a residential will get a thumbs-up from council for subdivision.\nIt’s likewise about exactly what the marketplace is prepared to bear. We have actually needed to knock back clients who weren’t prepared to quit enough of the block to make it beneficial.\nSubdividing Land And Building A Unit In The Backyard\nWhat effect does subdividing have on the worth of the existing residential or home? Carving off a piece of land will naturally lower the value of exactly what’s left. But the correlation is not simple. Exactly what you have actually done is change the market for the front home.\nIt will not appeal to families trying to find a big house and huge backyard to match, for instance, however it might appeal more to people who like that location which design of home but don’t care for a big backyard with all the maintenance that needs.\nAccording to some real estate agents, there is plenty of demand for houses without backyards, particularly in inner suburban areas. Some individuals like the area and they like the period design of the home on the block. So they enjoy to do without a backyard, however they will anticipate a discount rate.\nThe value of existing houses can be increased by a well-designed subdivision. In the process of subdividing land Heidelberg West we can spruce up the front home along with develop the new residential home at the back. You simply cannot have a gorgeous system at the back and a rundown weatherboard with a rough garden at the front.\nSome places begin as headaches when you finish them they look so great. We fix up the driveway, do landscaping, fencing, paint existing fences. What you’re developing is a good, cool, tidy functional block. In the majority of instances the experience has actually been a positive one. You will barely discover the new townhouse in your backyard and you will get a brand-new garage and fencing supplied by the subdividers.\nWays To Subdivide A Block Of Land In Heidelberg West VIC\nIncreasing house costs are fuelling demand for houses on carved-off land, while smaller inner-city blocks are motivating architects to be more creative with styles of so-called upside-down houses. In addition to yards, homeowner in Heidelberg West are also carving off their front lawns as well as tennis courts. Lots of subdivisions took place since asset-rich and cash-flow poor owners wished to unlock the worth of their land.\nBig blocks with potential to be portioned off are drawing strong interest. There was need for land with subdivision potential since “costs have actually gone skyward in Heidelberg West it’s ended up being almost unaffordable for a great deal of first home purchasers”.\nResident with a little block could benefit from the “upside down home” style, where the home was upstairs.

      "What are the benefits of doing burpees exercise?\nOther than the obvious benefits, like being a fantastic cardio session and an excellent strength builder – there are a few less obvious ones as well.\nAnd today, I’ll tell you all about them!\nHow to do a Burpee: The Basics\nA burpee goes like this:\n- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n- Lower into a squat.\n- Place your hands on the floor in front of your feet.\n- Jump your feet back into the plank position and complete a push-up.\n- Jump your feet forward to their original position.\n- Reach your arms above your head and jump with as much force as you can.\nThe burpee is a full-body workout, which means that you are working a truckload of muscles from head to toe in one single exercise.\nEvery single muscle in your entire body gets a piece of the action when you’re doing the burpee movements!\nUtilizing the burpee in a home exercise routine is perfect, incorporating both strength training and cardio in one go…\nYeah, I know. Pretty cool!\nThere are many variations to the burpee; some are harder than others.\nAt the end of this article, I have listed a few of them, but first -let’s have a look at why the burpee is so great:\nThe Benefits of Burpees Exercise\nBurpees Builds Strength!\nWhen you build muscle, you do so through muscle tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress.\nMuscle tension occurs when you do something your body was not previously adapted to. When you’re sore after a workout, you’re feeling muscle damage.\nMetabolic stress is the burning feeling you feel during a workout. When your cells swell around the muscle, they help heal and strengthen that muscle.\nThe burpee causes all three!\n“A single burpee demands that your entire body work to perform six bodyweight movements in a row (including three separate jumps) that take you from vertical to horizontal, back to vertical again.”\nReference: huffingtonpost.com/ Greatist – A Brief History Of The Burpee\nThe more burpees you do, the more of each you cause, -which contributes to muscle growth.\nThe more muscle we have, the higher our basal metabolic rate, -helping us lose weight.\nPretty nice, huh?\nView this post on Instagram\nDo Killer Cardio Workouts With Burpees\nThe burpee isn’t just strength training, however.\nActually, it is more so cardio.\nWhen we raise our heart rates to a certain point, we are engaging in cardiovascular exercise.\nCardio leads to:\n- weight loss,\n- a stronger heart,\n- less stress,\n- better sleep,\n- reduced risk of heart disease,\nand a lot more!\nThe burpee couples strength training with cardio to bring you the benefits of both worlds!\nTry doing a Tabata session only doing burpees…\nI promise, it will be one of the toughest 4 minutes of exercise you have ever experienced!\nThere are Tons of Burpee Variations\nBurpees come in a lot of forms.\nSome do mountain climbers in the push-up step of the exercise, further adding to the strength training component of a burpee.\nOthers do the double burpee, performing each step twice instead of once.\nSome even replace the push-up with a donkey kick!\nHowever you choose to change it, I will promise you this:\nThe burpee will NEVER bore you!\nFor ideas of variations, check out this excellent list showing you 15(!!!) different varieties of burpees: 15 New Burpees You Must Try.\nPro tip: Wear a weight vest while doing your burpees to x2-up the challenge!\nBurpee Challenge: The Burpee One Minute Race\nA simple, but yet super-effective cardio challenge with burpees is the “one minute race”.\nEvery day, you time one minute to see how many burpees you can complete.\nThis is a measure of your overall fitness because the number of burpees you can do should increase over time as your general fitness level gets better.\nDon’t expect a lot of changes from one day to the next but more gradually over a few weeks.\nPush your self to make sure your body really works towards its limit to get the best effect!\n“Cameron Dorn holds the world record for doing the most Burpees in 24 hours – 10,105! Keep that in mind next time you think your trainer is making you do too many.”\nReference: fbbcblog.com – 5 FUN FACTS ABOUT BURPEES\nFinal Words: Start Doing Burpees!\nSo, what are the benefits of doing burpees exercise?\nThe burpee is one of the most exhaustive exercises you can do without any equipment!\nUsing nothing but your body weight, willpower, and drive, you can work every major muscle in your body with this one exercise!\nSo; -with this, I challenge you:\nStart each morning with the one minute race and be prepared to see results to your general fitness level within weeks!\nDo you",
      "Apr 11-28 2001\nIn 1991, when the Singapore International Film Festival (SIFF) introduced the Silver Screen Award for the Best Asian Feature Film, it was the first international Asian festival with an award solely for Asian film. Since then, other Asian festivals such as Pusan have also commenced providing specialised platforms for Asian film.\nPast winners in Singapore include Tsai Ming-liang (Vive l’amour), Im Kwon-taek (Sopyonje), Zhang Yuan (Beijng Bastards), Chen Kaige (Life On a String), and Park Kwang-Su (Black Republic)\nSIFF was founded 14 years ago by film buffs, and since then has established a formidable reputation for showcasing Asian cinema. This year, some 350 films were shown from around the world and about 40 percent of the program was devoted to Asian films, with particular focus on the documentary genre.\nOf this year’s 16 films in competition, half had already picked up awards in other major festivals around the world.\nJafar Panahi’s The Circle (Dareyeh) won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival 2000. Deceptively structured around a day in the lives of several women, The Circle exposes the social repression, restrictions and injustice Iranian women experience in their everyday lives. 19 (Takhte Siah) won the Excellent Film Award at the PIA Film Festival. A radical and stylish first film by director Kazushi Watanabe, 19 is a bittersweet road movie about a lonely youth who becomes friends with his abductors. Watanabe kept the plot moving at a tight pace dazzling the audience with gestures, colour and light in the film.\nMarziyeh Meshkini (wife of acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf) won the Best Director Award at the Thessaloniki Film Festival 2000 with her self-scripted film The Day I Became A Woman (Roozi Keh Zan Shodam). The film is a powerful statement about the social oppression of women in Iran today. Marziyeh uses vivid imagery and allegorical storytelling in this tale shot on the Kish Island. Hong Sang-soo’s third and most accessible film, Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, received the Special Jury Prize at the Tokyo lnternational Film Festival 2000. This cryptic movie, shot in crisp black and white, plays like a Rashomon love triangle, exploring the ideas of random chance in its depiction of the encounters between the various combinations of the three leads.\nChunhyang by acclaimed and respected Korean director Im Kwon Taek, is the first South Korean film to screen in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. It won the Best Director Award at the SIFF. Based on a classic Korean folk tale of doomed lovers in the vein of Romeo And Juliet, the film is lifted by the narrative device of a pansori (traditional Korean music) singer. Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi) is a deeply felt and masterfully constructed biographical film which sees director Nun Bilge Ceylan depicting the life of his own family trying to live a rural and natural existence. The film won the FIPRESCI Grand Prize at the European Film Critics Award. It was awarded the Special Jury Award at the SIFF. Taiwan’s Lin Cheng-sheng won the Best Director award at the Berlin Film Festival 2001 for his film Betelnut Beauty – the story of a Taipei street-vendor who sells betelnuts, a local intoxicant. Her love for a Taiwanese youth is compromised by the temptations of the big city.\nThe big winner at the SIFF, however, was A Poet (Puisi Tak Terkuburkan) by Indonesia’s Garin Nugroho. Set during the bloody aftermath of the 1965 coup attempt in Indonesia, A Poet won the Best Film Award from the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (Netpac) while the film’s protagonist Ibrahim Kadir (who plays himself) won the prestigious Silver Screen Award for Best Actor.\nIbrahim was one of the thousands of people who were accused of being communists and unlawfully detained after the coup attempt. He spent 22 days in prison. The film tells how he dealt with the trauma of his detention and the witnessing of executions by putting these experiences into beautiful ballads in the tradition of didong (poetic ballad) from the central highlands of his native Aceh.\nThe other film to win two awards at the Festival was director Asoka Handagama’s This Is My Moon (Me Moge Sandai), which achieved a young Cinema Award as well as a special mention by Netpac. The film is about jealousy, betrayal, hatred and lust in a remote village in Sri Lanka, the emerald island that is losing much of its glitter due to the",

      "Attorney General Barr Is Already Declassifying Key SpyGate Evidence\nBy Brian Cates\nThere is a popular new narrative in both the Left and Right news media that when Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz has his latest report publicly released on December 9, it will lead to a huge letdown.\nIt is being claimed that Horowitz’s year and a half long deep dive into issues surrounding FISA warrants granted to the FBI targeting the Trump presidential campaign during the 2016 election – and continuing into the Trump administration itself through several renewals of that warrant – will lead to no criminal investigations and certainly not any criminal prosecutions.\nIt is confidently asserted that once again, the so called “Deep State” is about to demonstrate to the entire country how powerful it is, as we get to watch all the key SpyGate plotters walk away without any consequences.\nThose pushing this popular new narrative are, quite bluntly, absolutely wrong.\nSo blinded by their own narrative are many of these news media figures and commentators that they can’t even see what is happening right out in the open, in front of their eyes.\nThe Declassification of Key SpyGate Evidence Has Already Begun\nBecause many people have an unrealistic expectation of how Attorney General William Barr would go about declassifying the remaining SpyGate evidence and starting investigations based upon that newly declassified evidence, they don’t realize he’s already quietly doing it.\nThere is this expectation fixed in people’s minds that there will be some sort of official announcement, like a press conference or something, where Barr will hold up a binder full of documents and declare he’s just now done the long anticipated declassification of all the remaining classified SpyGate documents.\nBut that is not how Barr has been using the declassification powers that President Trump delegated to him back in May of this year. Instead of declassifying key documents all at once, dramatically, Barr has been doing it quietly one key document at a time.\nThat’s right. Barr has already been declassifying and releasing some of the key SpyGate evidence collected by IG Horowitz to at least one US Attorney we know of; John Durham. It is why we keep seeing announcements that Durham is expanding his criminal investigation into the origins of the RussiaGate hoax. In just the past week it was announced that Durham was now opening up two new fronts in his criminal probe:\n- A criminal case against a former FBI lawyer who was discovered to have altered a key FISA document and\n- An investigation into suspicious contracts out of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment [ONA] being awarded to key SpyGate informant Stefan Halper\nBarr has also taken action to give very recently declassified SpyGate evidence to the lawyers of the target of a malicious prosecution by the Mueller Special Counsel as it worked in concert with the SpyGate plotters. Sidney Powell, who is lead defense counsel for Lt. General Michael Flynn, revealed this newly declassified SpyGate evidence that had long been held back by the DOJ in her explosive court filing back on November 4.\nThe evidence consists of text messages and emails exchanged between former FBI officials Peter Strzok & Lisa Page in which they not only discuss tampering with the FD-302 form from the Flynn interview, they are also seen talking about how they can influence the judge who was presiding over Flynn’s case.\nThe Strzok/Page texts had been previously released but in a very heavily redacted form. Quietly, without fanfare or any public announcement, suddenly Flynn’s defense counsel was in possession of not only the unredacted text messages, but also may have been a draft section of Horowitz’s FISA report.\nThis is because Powell’s court filing contains an eye-opening three page exhibit in which Lisa Page is being interviewed by OIG investigators who ask her if she had made any material changes to the Flynn 302 form. When she denies having made any edits to the only official record of the Flynn interview, upon which the charge of perjury against him was founded, the OIG investigators then confronted Page with her own text messages exchanged with Peter Stzok, causing her to immediately change her story and admit she had edited the form.\nRecall that IG Horowitz first surfaced to hand off the first collection of SpyGate-related evidence to Congress in early December of 2017. That included a very large batch of Strzok/Page text messages. The Strzok/Page text messages that were unredacted got an immense amount of press coverage.\nLater, some text messages were unredacted in which the pair is seen discussing attempting to influence Judge Rudolph Contreras, who was presiding over Flynn’s perjury case.\n[Immediately after General Flynn pleaded guilty to a single count of perjury with that 302 form as the key evidence, Judge Contreras was suddenly recused from the case and replaced by Judge Emmet Sullivan]\nAt no time in the next two years, did we see the text messages that revealed Strzok and Page had also been discussing tampering with",
      "How surfing has changed my life\nAnd why I want to tell you about it.\nTHE FIRST WAVE\nWe are at the beginning of a story. And a story that is worth telling is a story that begins in a moment you will remember for the rest of your life.\nIt was November 2009. A winter break from university, in the middle of my political science career, led me to explore the island of Fuerteventura with my family. It was the second last day of my holiday. I had started a windsurfing course just because it was included in my super mega big all inclusive hotel. It was not that windy that day. But there were a lot of waves.\nNone of the participants managed to hold the big sail of the windsurf board and keep the balance on it. When the instructor realized it, he removed the sail from the board and surprised us by saying, decisively: “Ok, let’s try another sport!”. Now, just imagine for a moment. You are standing on a windsurf board – which is at least twice the size of a standard surfboard – in a position which you think might be the right surfing position. Your instructor is behind you, waiting for the right moment to push your board when the waves approach. Considering that you normally start surfing from a lying position, you paddle and only then do you stand up on the board, that’s pretty hilarious. But that’s how it went. The first time I fell off. The second time, of course, I fell off again. But right before the third wave reached the board, the instructor told me: “Antonio, stay lower and put your arms in the front to get more stability”. And here we go. I still remember that wonderful moment. It’s coming in front of my eyes right now. That wave taking me to the shore. That huge board sliding on the surface of the water, dragged by the wave. The incredible feeling of moving in complete harmony with the ocean. I felt time stop and my mind get empty. Ashore, I fell off the board, I got up and I said to myself: “I’m gonna do this for the rest of my fucking life”.\nPhoto credit @Pablo Borboroglu photography\nNow imagine the life of an Italian 21-year-old guy who lives close to Venice, who catches the train every day to go attend university in Padua, all dressed up, holding his newspaper. A guy who has just started to write articles for the culture section of a local newspaper. Imagine the life of this young guy suddenly shaken by an experience like this.\nBOOM BOOM BABY.\nEvery day & every night, thinking about that moment. Imagine that guy living his regular life, waiting for spring to have his surf lessons at the closest beach. May 1st, 2010, in Sottomarina, close to the Venice lagoon. Yes, I know, it sounds like a joke. But that’s what happened – and there are actually some nice waves out there (sometimes!).\nIf you want to have a glimpse into what it’s like to surf in the beaches of Venice, here you have an example. Full wetsuit, hood and booties. Our friend Matteo pushed himself beyond his limits without wearing gloves in the cold water of Jesolo.\nPhoto credit @Matteo Caeran\nSuddenly my life started to focus just around surfing. I started practicing as much as I could, renting a board from a friend who was setting up a surf kiosk at Jesolo beach – shout out to Ale from Yes We Surf ! I started to get into it. I took a couple of friends into it as well and there we go, with the first surf trips again to Fuerteventura, Cape verde and Levanto, which I discovered being one of the main capitals of surfing in Italy. In the meantime, normal life was going on. But what is normal? Is the desire to live a different life something normal? This is what we are all led to think. Like robots, we wake up every day, automatic systems working on their own, and we do what it is considered normal. Going to university, studying, working at the weekends to save money. But slowly my mind started to clear up. There was something that I needed to change. My vision of life was changing. I was not hooked to the place where I was born, anymore.\nThe desire of surfing different waves created a bigger desire of traveling and visiting new places. The desire of getting to know different cultures and speaking different languages. And tell me now, what would you do if you were a university student who’s started feeling like this? Drop everything and change your life? No, not yet. Still too early. When you grow up in a northern Italian city, the Society tells you that you need to finish your studies. That you need to be a “dottore”, that’s the way you’re called in Italy at the end of your",

      "President Vladimir Putin has made several appeals to the public in recent months. Both the form and content of those messages are new to the Russian leader's political arsenal. Two films were foremost among those communications: \"Crimea —The Way Home\" and another, titled simply \"President.\"\nBoth movies were built largely upon extended and detailed interviews with Putin, along with accompanying interviews with people that did not so much communicate something new as flesh out and corroborate the main points of Putin's message.\nObservers speculated that the films represented Putin's attempt to either \"send a signal\" to the West or else bolster ratings by a few percentage points. Neither theory holds any water. The messages these interviews convey are difficult to translate and deeply connected with the Russian cultural context and the Russian language itself.\nTaken out of context and translated into a foreign language, those communiques would do more to confuse a listener than clarify Putin's position. For example, some observers interpreted several phrases in the film \"Crimea — The Way Home\" as indicating that Putin was threatening to use nuclear weapons.\nAnd the idea that Putin is trying to boost his ratings looks far-fetched considering that he already enjoys record high popularity and that Russians will have nobody else to vote for in the foreseeable future.\nThen, in the final days of April, Putin published an article in which he described very personal feelings and memories of his parents and his childhood after World War II. The high point of this chain of events was Putin's heading the ''Immortal Regiment'' on May 9. Together with tens of thousands of people, he marched with the photo of his father along Moscow's streets.\nOn the one hand, Putin's article about his family's life during wartime and his participation in the Immortal Regiment march probably serve as the logical conclusion to the subjects raised by the previous two films, and, on the other hand, clarify the rationale behind producing those films.\nIn my opinion, all of this was not so much an attempt to send a signal to the West or earn a few more percentage points in the ratings, but an emotional attempt to bypass the ruling elite and communicate directly with a broad cross section of the Russian population that sees the world much as he does. It represents almost a longing for intimacy.\nIt is a very sad and touching display. The Russian president seems to yearn for a sincere mutual interchange, even while locking himself away in the Kremlin fortress and refusing to betray even a slightest weakness or shortcoming in any area.\nPutin seems to be appealing to the Russian people not to worship or curse him, not to merely use or fear him, but to share their thoughts and emotions with him. He is asking them to take an interest in his life, his personal story, his views and motivations. He wants people to see him as he really is, not the way he appears from the Kremlin podium.\nIn short, Putin appears to be reaching out for the very things a healthy family life would ordinarily provide. The article, the films, the activities of the All-Russia People's Front, the informal visits to provincial churches during services — all of that is a sort of artificial family, a simulation of family amusements, an attempt to approximate what it feels like to share family stories with the children over the weekend, go to the movies and to live the simple life of an ordinary person.\nThis man is not \"threatening the world,\" but seeking protection from the world. His desire for family is a self-protective mechanism, and the search for family is the search for safety, security, a way to reduce the pressure and threat, a means for casting off the unbearable weight of authority and to share that burden with truly close family members.\nIf that is the case, then this is certainly an interesting experiment. No Russian leader has ever genuinely viewed the people of this country as members of an extended family — as tools, yes, or as \"worthless clay\" from which he could mold them as he pleased — but never as kin. That is a new model.\nHowever, this \"family\" model might not work so well. The ruling elite cannot feel very happy about seeing their leader ignore them in favor of the Russian people. It turns out that they do not fulfill the role of family members for Putin and that the president must look elsewhere for that connection.\nIt means that Putin uses them as servants, channels of his political will and top managers, but has no use for them as brothers, children or cousins. That must leave senior officials feeling a bit cheated, like getting handed a cheap tinsel Christmas tree ornament instead of the real thing.\nIn modern Russia, political considerations have narrowed to the confines of one man's psychological dimensions. It turns out that this man, working alone, is shaping the country's political and social spheres so as to bring comfort to his own mind and heart. This belies the myth that Putin makes his decisions and carries them out with the aid of a modern-day Politburo — the rationale behind targeted Western sanctions against members of the president's inner circle.\nThe Politburo supposed a sort of",

      "SOLIDWORKS Simulation is a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program built into the familiar SOLIDWORKS CAD interface. Simulation provides designers and engineers the tools they need to quickly test their designs and intelligently iterate on them. Utilizing NAFEMS validated FEA solvers, SOLIDWORKS Simulation can provide accurate, reliable results for a wide range of study types from basic linear static analysis to more complex nonlinear and dynamic analysis. Speed up the iteration and prototyping phase of your design process with SOLIDWORKS Simulation.\nAccuracy and reliability is a common question of all Simulation tools. How do we know the results can be trusted? Fortunately, there is an independent group that handles this. The National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards (NAFEMS) tests simulation programs against benchmark studies with known results that have been validated mathematically and empirically. All study types available in SOLIDWORKS Simulation have been tested and validated by NAFEMS.\nStill not convinced? SOLIDWORKS has included setup guides and the NAFEMS benchmark models in the Simulation software so users can run the analysis and compare the results themselves.\nAnalysis tools designed to optimize your testing.\nTest designs using linear materials under steady-state load conditions to quickly analyze and iterate designs based on stress, strain, displacement, and Factor of Safety (FOS) results. The included Trend Tracker tool helps engineers to track the results of design changes automatically.\nLeverages user-defined constraints (mates) in assemblies and mechanical inputs (gravity, springs, dampers, forces, etc.) to accurately recreate the mechanical movement of the assembly and provide designers with reaction forces, position, acceleration, and velocities.\nUsed to test the life of designs due to fatigue failure, engineers can apply multiple load scenarios including varying and cyclic loads where peak stress is below material yield to understand the expected life-span of their designs.\nAlso known as modal analysis, this test is used to determine both the modal shape and natural frequencies of both parts and assemblies. This is critical information for an Engineer to have when creating designs that will be subjected to vibration inputs or used in vibrating environments.\nThis test gives engineers a method to study and understand the heat transfer, both steady-state and transient, through conduction between components as well as both radiation and convection into the surrounding environment. The results of this analysis can be used in a stress analysis to see how the thermal conditions will affect the stress and displacement in a part or assembly.\nRather than creating a design and validating it, this study allows engineers to specify the “bounding box”, stiffness, weight and frequency requirements of the component and allow the software to generate the ideal shape to meet those requirements while considering manufacturing constraints.\nAllows designers to rapidly test and optimize a design based on variables such as dimensions, and materials with given constraints and overall goals such as weight, strength, frequency, and even manufacturing cost.\nUsed to analyze load-bearing structures that are placed under compressive forces to accurately test the Factor of Safety (FOS) against buckling failure of a design.\nProvides an easy to use tool for simulating drop test impacts of components and assemblies. Drop test analysis gives full control on the impact surface, height, velocity, and angle of the drop to understand how a design will behave when subjected to a drop impact.\nRubbers, plastics, Nitinol, and other nonlinear materials cannot be accurately tested with a linear solver. Nonlinear analysis allows engineers to use advanced material models to accurately analyze designs that incorporate these materials.\nUsed when designing with materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber, this study allows engineers to specify fiber orientation and layup schedule for their designs. The results provide information on stresses at each layer as well as interlaminar stresses and composite specific results like Tsai Hill and Tsai Wu.\nAllows designers to test Modal Time History, Harmonic Analysis, Random Vibration, and Response Spectrum of components and assemblies. Results such as transient response, peak response, stress, acceleration, and displacement can be provided by this type of analysis.\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation Standard allows users to use connections such as bolts and pins to stress test their assemblies, simulate realistic assembly motion, and calculate joint forces.\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation Professional offers a comprehensive toolset for improved assembly simulation. Functionality includes calculation of modal vibration, transient thermal temperature loading, DoE and topology optimization, and more!\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation Premium allows users to perform high-level non-linear simulations for exotic materials, complex load cases, and large deformation problems.

      "This week, we asked readers of the Politics & Politics Daily to share their favorite characters from political movies and TV. Here are some of our favorite responses:\nNeel Lahiri’s pick was Selina Meyer from the TV show Veep, a character “who epitomizes the kind of farcical, utterly vain, and insatiably power-hungry [politician] that the electorate despises.”\nFrom reader Christina Kopp:\nMy favorite political figure on TV is Laura Roslin, President of the Twelve Colonies in the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. When faced with the annihilation of the human race, she doesn’t give up and doesn’t give in. Ah, only on TV!\nTerry Nugent picked Bill McKay from the film The Candidate, “an elegant chronicle of the withering effect of electioneering on ethics.” (Speaking of Bill, another reader analyzed him and his ethical evolution as part of our “Political Theater” series earlier this year.)\nKennedy Avery suggested Josh Lyman, the Deputy Chief of Staff to President Bartlet in The West Wing:\nI like how Josh is brash, compassionate, and humorous all at once. Plus, when it comes to his work and policy positions, he is unapologetic and determined.\nJoan Conroy also had a West Wing-themed response:\nThe first one who came to mind was Toby Ziegler, played by Richard Schiff. As the sad, often morose, but brilliant liberal speech writer he refused to compromise his ideals. Nor was he seduced by power and money, as far too many are in the current political climate.\nAnd Deb Bell wrote:\nMy favorite character is Chauncey Gardner, from the 1979 film Being There. It’s the story of a mentally challenged gardener whose simple-minded utterances and complete ignorance of government, diplomacy, and the outside world as a whole are mistaken for wisdom and bold thought, propelling him toward political superstardom.\nWe can all agree that 2016 has been a long year, but this week, we asked Politics & Policy Daily readers to explain what they’re most thankful for in the world of politics. Here were some of our favorite responses:\nMiriam Helbok said she’s grateful for Bernie Sanders’s campaign because it “energized and perhaps even awakened thousands of young people to the importance of taking an active part in maintaining our democracy.”\nFor several readers, including David Lippman, Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s loss in Arizona was “the only piece of positive news in a horrifying political year.”\nCarl Dennis writes:\nOne of my favorite political responses this year happened as a result of one of the greatest tragedies in American history. After the shooting in Orlando at a gay bar, the outpouring of support and love expressed by political figures of both parties from President Obama to GOP figures gave me a glimmer of hope that in spite of our differences, we will be able to come together to support one another.\n1. Ken Bone. At a time of high tension between Democrats and Republicans, he gave us a couple things we could all agree on: his awesomeness and how adorable he is.\n2. That the government didn't shut down this year! The little things go a long way!\n3. Saturday Night Live. Larry David as Bernie Sanders and Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump have been nothing short of amazing.\n4. That Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could find something they liked about each other when prompted to do so.\nThe election is over! Happy Thanksgiving!\nOn that note, Craig K. Lehman is grateful that at least we’ve reached “the end of the Bush and Clinton dynasties.”\nDavid Caskey, from University Park, Maryland, is thankful for California:\nGovernor Brown signed a law which will require farm workers to get overtime after an eight-hour day. No developed society I know of has been this committed to a decent life for those who labor for our food.\nTrump was defeated in California by over 3 million votes. Big old California gives me hope for America.\nAnd finally, Barry Tarshis wrote in to say that he’s “thankful to be a Canadian.” Thanks for that, Barry.\nThis week we asked our Politics & Policy Daily readers what they thought the presidential candidates should be for Halloween, and we got a number of great responses. Thanks to everyone—and there were several—who suggested Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump simply dress as each other to achieve peak scariness.\nBut props to Joanne Allard from Tucson for a truly creative submission: Allard suggested Clinton will dress as Ellen Ripley, the protagonist from the 1979 film Alien, while Trump go as the alien, wearing an orange headpiece. From Joanne:\nI will resist the temptation to suggest her obvious catchphrase, except to point out that it would, of course, be delivered upon her reaching in to grab, er, to extract The Donald.\nReader James Miles suggested Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson dress as Elmer Fudd, and John Bian",
      "One more time, Happy New Year! I’m sorry, I had to get that in for anyone who doesn’t know we’ve had a date change in the year column. And I don’t know about you, but it sounds weird, saying we haven’t seen her since last year, en masse. Tack on that week she took off and I’m sure y’all were rocking back and forth like me, lookin’ like crack-fiend Pookie in “New Jack City”.\nNeed my Chante. Gotta have my Chante. Excuse me sir, I’ll wash your car if you got some Chante. I’ll dance for you. I can’t help it, man, she just be calllllin’ me. I gotta go to her. I gotta listen…\nThat being said… …let’s get this recap started!\nShe started off by thanking everyone for giving love and support for her appearance in The Shade Room which needs to be changed to the Sunshine Room because she brought in a supernova of glowing magnificence with her performance of “Chante’s Got A Man”! Sistah girl ripped it uuuuuuuup!\nOver 1,000,000 viewers in less than 24 hours.\nShe shared that her New Year celebration was a quieter one, spent with family, much as it was for most of us. I’d like to think that the great majority of us, if not all, spent it at home, avoiding exposure to COVID-19. If not, shame on you!\nThis week’s show was to be a “shorter set” as she put it because she was headed to hang out with a friend. Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that. Strengthen those bonds of friendship, folks. In many cases, they’re just as important as family.\nShe was asked if she had any New Year’s Resolutions and she answered that she was supposed to keep working hard, being purposeful in all that she does, remaining positive and staying the course. She expects great things to come. Through all of the troubles last year, she managed to find opportunities for growth.\nShe reminded everyone to stay strong…\n…and when you’re not strong, rest.\nWorks for me…\nAfter singing her classic, “It’s Alright“, she reiterated just that – ‘everything’s gon’ be alright’. She said that although she didn’t know the future, worrying about it wouldn’t change anything. If you want something to change, change. Change, change, CHANGE!\nIn talking about her love for her children and the fact that there is nothing she wouldn’t do for them, she encouraged us to fight and endure. Persevere. Take the pain, walk through fire and emerge as pure gold. Just like gold, we have to experience the refining process. We may not like it because it hurts, but in the end, we’ll all be happier and better for it. Remember, if you’re going through hell, keep going. Eventually we’ll all come out on the other side.\n- “Theme From Welcome Back Kotter” by John Sebastian (I was cra-cking-UP when I heard those opening piano strokes, immediately recognizing this tune. I’m sure a good 50% of the viewers had no earthly idea what she was singing, not being 70s kids or 80s teens. But us grown folk new! Only Chante can do something like that AND make it adorable. Useless Trivia Fact #721: I used this song as the theme song on the main page of my high school reunion website.)\n- “It’s Alright” by Chante Moore (New Year and a beautiful new feeling, every time she sings that song. ’nuff said.)\nShe provided for feedback, asking what we’d like to see in next week’s show. So between now and then, she’d like us all to say whether we’d like to see a Workout or Makeup Tutorial. So vote now! That’s your homework assignment, due ASAP. I already KNOW I want to see a Makeup Tutorial because I ain’t brave enough to walk around without makeup like Alicia Keys. I’d vote for the workout, but LAST time she did that, I strained my right earlobe. Nooooo thank you…\nBut I know that Chante is cool with me missing a workout or two, or three. Right Chante? Right? RIGHT??? Hello?\nChante’s Words Of Wisdom: To HAVE it all, you’ve got to GIVE it all.\n…and that’s it for this week’s recap. As I mentioned earlier, this was an abbreviated show, but still wonderful. I’ll see you all next Chantday (Sunday for you newbies), so save me a spot in the audience, somewhere on your living room couch and have ice cream ready. I love mint chocolate or vanilla bean with root beer or orange pop (not soda). Then it’s right back here for another episode.\nIf you’d like to send Chante"
